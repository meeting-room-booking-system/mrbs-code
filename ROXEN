running the Roxen web server.

Hi Daniel,

Great to see that you're willing to put together a new updated version.
Bo Kleve has been VERY active lately fixing a lot of bugs.

Since I'm using the Roxen webserver, I could only get PHP to work as a
cgi interpreter (for now). Thus authentification cannot be done the
usual way. I thus wrote a "auth_ext_cookie.ext" module (attached to this
e-mail) - the "config.inc" and "mrbs.css"  files need the following:

config.inc:

$auth[CJ_cookie_name] = "CJ_mrbs_auth_cookie";
$auth[CJ_cookie_life_time] = 600;
$auth[CJ_cookie_domain] = ".mrl.ucsb.edu";
$auth[CJ_cookie_directory] = "/mrbs-0.9/";
$auth[CJ_logon_message] = "Please log in.";
$auth[CJ_tryagain_message] = "Please try again.";

mrbs.css:

TD.CJ {border:0px; font-size: 16pt;}

I don't know if you want this to be part of the official destribution -
I might not be of general interest !! - but if you think so: Probably
the CJ prefix on all the variables should be dropped !!

Thanx,
Claus
