Upgrade Information for previous releases of MRBS:
--------------------------------------------------

If you are upgrading from MRBS 1.2-pre3 or later, then MRBS will
automatically execute any necessary database upgrades when it is first
run.   It will prompt you for a database (not MRBS) username and password
with rights to create and alter tables.

It would be a sensible precaution to take a backup of your database before
the upgrade.

MRBS database upgrades are in general intended to be backwards compatible,
so that you should still be able to run the old version of MRBS against the
new database schema.   This will allow you to install the new version of MRBS
in a separate directory while you configure and test it.   When you are happy
with the new release you can switch the directory to be your production
directory.

There are however some exceptions to this backward compatiblity, namely at
the following transitions:

MRBS 1.4.4.1 -> 1.4.5

In these cases you will not be able to run the old version of MRBS against
the upgraded database.   You may therefore choose to make a copy of the
database for test purposes and check that the upgrade process works before
performing the upgrade on your production database.

Upgrading from prior MRBS 1.4.9
===============================

MRBS now supports the $vocab_override config variable.   See
systemdefaults.inc.php for more details.  If you have customised your version
of MRBS by editing the lang files, you are advised to use $vocab_override instead.
This will make future upgrades easier.


Upgrading from prior MRBS 1.4.6
===============================

If you were previously using MRBS with $unicode_encoding set to 0, when
you upgrade to 1.4.6 you _MUST_ upgrade the MySQL database from the
previously used character set to Unicode :

          You need to use the convert_db_to_utf8.php script to convert text
          in the database to UTF8. The administrator should copy the file
          into the web directory, run it (choosing the encoding to convert
          from) ONCE, and then move it back out of the web directory. We
          recommend you backup your database before running this script if
          you are at all worried.
          Running it more than once will make a right mess of any non-ASCII 
          text in the database. 

          Additionally, this script can correct an MRBS database that used
          to run on an old version of MySQL (earlier than 4.1), but that
          now run on a newer version of MySQL. In this case, the database
          contains UTF-8 text, but the tables are considered to be in some
          other encoding by MySQL, generally Latin-1. The
          convert_db_to_utf8.php detects this condition, and offers
          the administrator the chance to correct the database 'collation'.

===

The following configuration variables are now deprecated.   Their use is
supported for the moment but you should change your config file now to
use the new variables as support for the old variables may be dropped in the
future:

$mail_settings['admin_all']        replaced by  $mail_settings['on_new'] and
                                                $mail_settings['on_change']
$mail_settings['admin_on_delete']  replaced by  $mail_settings['on_delete']
$dateformat                        replaced by  $strftime_format['daymonth']


Upgrading from prior MRBS 1.4.5
===============================
MRBS 1.4.5 introduces the concept of tentative bookings, or bookings that
require confirmation.   To avoid confusion, what were previously known as
"provisional bookings" have now been renamed "bookings requiring approval"
and the config variable $provisional_enabled has been renamed
$approval_enabled.   You should update your config file accordingly.

Please also see the note about database compatibility above.


Upgrading from prior MRBS 1.2-pre3
==================================

mrbs 1.2-pre3 introduced area and room administrator email fields.

Please apply the upgrade3.my.sql to add these fields. This file should work 
both with mysql and pgsql.


Upgrading from prior MRBS 1.2-pre2
==================================

Upgrading mysql database from previous charsets to Unicode :

          You can use convert_db_to_utf8.php script to convert text in the 
          database to UTF8. The administrator should copy the file into
          the web directory, run it (choosing the encoding to convert from)
          ONCE, and then move it back out of the web directory. We recommend
          you backup your database before running this script if you are at
          all worried.
          Running it more than once will make a right mess of any non-ASCII 
          text in the database. 


Upgrading from prior to MRBS 1.0 final
======================================

Please apply the upgrade2.my.sql (if using MySQL) or the
the upgrade2.pg.sql (if using PostgreSQL) script, which
adds a new column to the 'mrbs_repeat' table to support
"n-weekly" repeats.


Upgrading from prior to MRBS 1.0-pre1
======================================

A change in version 1.0-pre1 might affect the appearance of entries in your
existing database. Prior versions of MRBS did an extra and unnecessary
level of backslash-escaping on room, area, and entry names and
descriptions. This applied to certain characters such as single quote
mark(') and backslash(\). As of version 1.0-pre1, these characters are
handled correctly. If you see extra backslashes when MRBS displays names or
descriptions, it is because these are in actually your database.  You can
edit the entries in MRBS or directly with your database SQL tool, or just
ignore them.


Upgrading from prior to MRBS 0.7
================================
There was a change to the database schema at version 0.7. See the
information in INSTALL on using the upgrade.my.sql script.
