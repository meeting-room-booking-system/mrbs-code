Upgrade Information for previous releases of MRBS:
--------------------------------------------------

There is a change to the database schema in this version of MRBS, this is a
side effect of the change of database wrapper. Although, naturally, you
should back up any data you have before using a new version.

Currently this version of mrbs allow to upgrade from a previous version
starting with mrbs-1-0-final. Previous versions can't be upgraded with this
script. To change the format of your data do:

[MySQL]         $ mysql mrbs < upgrade.my.sql
+++++++++++++++++++++TODO : upgrade pgsql----------------------------

A change in version 1.0-pre1 might affect the appearance of entries in your
existing database. Prior versions of MRBS did an extra and unnecessary
level of backslash-escaping on room, area, and entry names and
descriptions. This applied to certain characters such as single quote
mark(') and backslash(\). As of version 1.0-pre1, these characters are
handled correctly. If you see extra backslashes when MRBS displays names or
descriptions, it is because these are in actually your database.  You can
edit the entries in MRBS or directly with your database SQL tool, or just
ignore them.

Upgrading from prior to mrbs 1.0 final
======================================

Please apply the upgrade2.my.sql (if using MySQL) or the
the upgrade2.my.sql (if using PostgreSQL) script, which
adds a new column to the 'mrbs_repeat' table to support
"n-weekly" repeats.

Thereafter you can run the upgrade.xx.sql patch.
