Upgrade Information for previous releases of MRBS:
--------------------------------------------------

There was a change to the database schema at version 0.7. See the
information in INSTALL on using the upgrade.my.sql script.

There have been no database changes from version 0.7, so your current
database should work just fine. Although, naturally, you should back up
any data you have before using a new version.

A change in version 1.0-pre1 might affect the appearance of entries in your
existing database. Prior versions of MRBS did an extra and unnecessary
level of backslash-escaping on room, area, and entry names and
descriptions. This applied to certain characters such as single quote
mark(') and backslash(\). As of version 1.0-pre1, these characters are
handled correctly. If you see extra backslashes when MRBS displays names or
descriptions, it is because these are in actually your database.  You can
edit the entries in MRBS or directly with your database SQL tool, or just
ignore them.
