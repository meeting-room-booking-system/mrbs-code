Meeting Room Booking System
http://mrbs.sourceforge.net/
-------------------------------

The Meeting Room Booking System (MRBS) is a PHP/MySQL-based application for
booking meeting rooms (surprisingly!). I got annoyed with the piles of books
which were being used to book meetings. They were slow, hard to edit and only at
the reception desk. I thought that a nice web-based system would be much nicer.

Some parts of this are based on WebCalender 0.9.4 by Craig Knudsen 
(http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/webcalendar/) but there is now very little which
is similar. There are fundamental design goal differences between WebCalendar
and MRBS - WC is for individuals, MRBS is for meeting rooms.

------
To Use
------
See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Once it's installed try going to http://wherever/mrbs/ - this should give you
a view of the default "Building 1" meeting rooms for today. The (+) symbol means
you can add new meetings by clicking here. Try it - it should all be pretty
obvious.

Try viewing http://wherever/mrbs/testdata.php3 - it will generate a whole load
of random appointments to fill up the calendar and let you play around.

When used for real all bookings have the originating IP address logged against
them. This is used as a poor man's security device as only the IP Address that
made a booking can change or delete it. I plan to do some sort of plug-in
security thing for the future. With the testdata.php3 script all bookings are
made against $REMOTE_ADDR.

Administration is done from admin.php3 - you can add or delete rooms and areas.
There is no security for this, but if you really care that much you can use your
webserver to add some.

I've only tested this using PHP 3.0.16, Apache 1.3.12, mySQL 3.22.32 and Linux
2.2.14, although it should work on just about anything that's got mySQL and
PHP with mySQL support - let me know.

Right now it seems really rather stable, but there could be some more features.

It should be pretty easy to adjust it to your corporate colours - the file mrbs.css is used on every page, as is style.inc. Just fiddle with these until you get the result you like. If it's really funky then please send it to me, and I'll start some sort of 'skin' collection!

I don't really know if this is being used by anyone in any real environment. I'm using it at work, with about 150 clients, but that's all I know. If you do start using it can you drop me a note to let me know how you've got on.
