Originally MRBS did not have username/password support. Each booking that was
made had the IP address of the client machine logged as the "creator" of
the booking.

In this case the IP address functions as the "username".

This works well in my case, where all IPs are static, and everyone is
allowed access to the system, although in the wider world there are
occasions where this is a little too liberal.

To combat this MRBS 0.8 introduced authentication, initially provided by Sam
Mason <smason@mtc.ricardo.com>.

There are three levels of access in MRBS:
   Level 0 - not logged in
   Level 1 - Authenticated
   Level 2 - Administrator

The administrators are allowed to modify other people's bookings, whereas
Level 1 users can only change their own.

Administrators are defined in config.inc. This is done by specifying:
   $auth[admin][] = "username";
   $auth[admin][] = "username2";
   etc

You can have as many administrators as you want.

The default configuration has a few 10.10. IP addresses as administrators -
you may want to change these.


Different Auth Schemes
----------------------

The Authentication scheme is designed to be flexible, with "plug-in" auth
modules. Sam Mason originally provided code for authenticating to a SMB server
(NT Domain stuff).

Out of the box MRBS is configured using the traditional "IP address"
authentication.

The other auth provider which ships with MRBS is the "external" one. This
uses Basic Authorization to get usernames and passwords, and an external
program to decide if the username/password combination is valid.

The external program must take the username, password and possibly other
values as parameters - it's exit code must be a zero for "OK" and anything
else for "not OK".

I have included a short piece of Perl which can quickly be used to
demonstrate how the "external" provider works.

"badpw.pl" has usernames and passwords hard coded. I don't expect anyone to
use this in a production environment - it's just to demonstrate.

In the config.inc file there is a section that says:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth[realm]  = "";
$auth[type]   = "ip";
$auth[prog]   = "";
$auth[params] = "";

Change this to:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth[realm]  = "MRBS";
$auth[type]   = "ext";
$auth[prog]   = "/home/httpd/html/mrbs/badpw.pl";
$auth[params] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";

Obviously, you need to put an appropriate path.

Once you have changed this then look at the /mrbs/ page through your
browser. When you click one of the (+) buttons, you will be asked for a
username and password. Check badpw.pl for the valid combinations.

To try out an "admin" user, add an appropriate username to the section that
says:
   $auth[admin][] = "....";

   
SMB Authentication
------------------

I haven't tried this method, so here are Sam Mason's instructions for using
his SMB authentication:

-------
As I said in the last mail, it uses an external program to do the
authentication, this is a very simple program, that returns "true" if the
username/password are valid and "false" otherwise.

Included is the source (smb_auth.c) to compile it download the "pam_smb"
library from some where that mirrors samba
(http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.samba.org/pam_smb/) copy the source into
the main source directory, and compile (having made the PAM library its
self) with something like.

gcc -o smb_auth smb_auth.c smbval/smbvalid.a

and copy the binary to somewhere useful I chose "/usr/bin/smb_auth"

[snip]

It requires the "smb_auth" program to be installed and working see
"config.inc" to use a different authentication program + set the servers +
domain used for the name checks.
-------

The config.inc entries he supplied were:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth[realm]  = "MRBS";
$auth[type]   = "ext";
$auth[prog]   = "/usr/bin/smb_auth";
$auth[params] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD# SERVER BACKUP DOMAIN";

The [params] are:
   * #USERNAME# is replaced by the actual username presented
   * #PASSWORD# is replaced by the user's password
   * Primary Server used for password validation
   * Secondary server used for password validation
   * NT domain under which the user is registered


Netware Authentication
----------------------
This is only going to work on Linux.

There's a program called "nwauth" which is included with ncpfs. To use it you'll
need to have IPX support compiled in your kernel. There might be other requirements as
well - see the stuff that comes with ncpfs.

You can get it from ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/

I've only tested this with ncpfs-2.2.0.18

The appropriate settings for config.inc are:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth[realm]  = "MRBS";
$auth[type]   = "ext";
$auth[prog]   = "/usr/bin/nwauth";
$auth[params] = "-S MYSERVER -U #USERNAME# -P #PASSWORD#";


LDAP Authentication
-------------------
There is a very small Perl program - ldap_auth.pl - included with this
distribution.

It requires the Net::LDAP module be installed and working. For me this simply
meant doing:

   perl -MCPAN -e"install Net::LDAP"

The script simply attemps to bind to a server using a supplied dn and password.
It expects the full thing to be passed in - eg 

   cn=root, o=University of Michigan, c=us

In my case, I can pass just the cn and it works. My config.inc settings are:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth[realm]  = "MRBS";
$auth[type]   = "ext";
$auth[prog]   = "/home/httpd/html/mrbs/auth_ldap.pl";
$auth[params] = "LDAPSERVER cn=#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";



Creating a new authentication scheme
------------------------------------

There are generic authentication functions in "mrbs_auth.inc", with functions
specific to a particular scheme in "auth_xxx.inc"

The "auth_xxx.inc" file needs to define certain functions:
   getAuth($realm)
      Request that the username/password be given for the specified realm

   authValidateUser($user, $pass)
      Checks if the specified username/password pair are valid

   authGetUserLevel($user)
      Determines the users access level

   getUserName()
      Returns the current user name
      
   getUserPassword()
      Retuens the current password
      
The "auth_ext.inc" file shows good examples of the use of these functions.

I think that the "ext" provider will be the most useful, because it can use
any external program to do the authentication.

For instance, to authenticate to an LDAP server, it would be relatively easy
to write a small program in [insert language of choice] which took
username, password and server name as parameters, and returned 0 for
"yes, this username/password is OK", and something else for "no, it's not".
The config.inc entries for this might look like:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth[realm]  = "MRBS";
$auth[type]   = "ext";
$auth[prog]   = "/usr/bin/ldap_auth";
$auth[params] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD# LDAP_SERVER";

"auth_ext.inc" constructs a command line to execute like:

   $cmd = $auth[prog] . ' ' . $auth[params];
   $cmd = preg_replace('/#USERNAME#/',$user,$cmd);
   $cmd = preg_replace('/#PASSWORD#/',$pass,$cmd);

This should allow a lot of flexibility with different authenticators.

The "auth_ip.inc" shows how it is possible to use any arbitrary value as the
"username" (in this case the value of $REMOTE_ADDR)


If you do create some new authentication provider, then please send it to
me and I'll include it in the main distribution.
