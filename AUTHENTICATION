Originally MRBS did not have username/password support. Each booking that was
made had the IP address of the client machine logged as the "creator" of
the booking.

In this case the IP address functions as the "username".

This works well in my case, where all IPs are static, and everyone is
allowed access to the system, although in the wider world there are
occasions where this is a little too liberal.

To combat this MRBS 0.8 introduced authentication, initially provided by Sam
Mason <smason@mtc.ricardo.com>.

There are three levels of access in MRBS:
   Level 0 - not logged in
   Level 1 - Authenticated
   Level 2 - Administrator

The administrators are allowed to modify other people's bookings, whereas
Level 1 users can only change their own.  Admistrators also have the ability to
add and remove rooms and areas.

Administrators are defined in config.inc.php. This is done by specifying:
   $auth["admin"][] = "username";
   $auth["admin"][] = "username2";
   etc
If IP authentication is used, for "username" use the IP address.

You can have as many administrators as you want.

The default configuration uses IP address for authentication, and defines
the local host (127.0.0.1) as the only administrator. You will almost
surely want to change these.

Different Auth Schemes
----------------------

The Authentication scheme is designed to be flexible, with "plug-in" auth
modules. Sam Mason originally provided code for authenticating to a SMB server
(NT Domain stuff).

Out of the box MRBS is configured using the traditional "IP address"
authentication.

The other auth provider which ships with MRBS is the "external" one. This
uses Basic Authorization to get usernames and passwords, and an external
program to decide if the username/password combination is valid.

The external program must take the username, password and possibly other
values as parameters - it's exit code must be a zero for "OK" and anything
else for "not OK".

I have included a short piece of Perl which can quickly be used to
demonstrate how the "external" provider works.

"badpw.pl" has usernames and passwords hard coded. I don't expect anyone to
use this in a production environment - it's just to demonstrate.

In the config.inc.php file there is a section that says:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth["realm"]  = "";
$auth["type"]   = "ip";
$auth["prog"]   = "";
$auth["params"] = "";

Change this to:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth["realm"]  = "MRBS";
$auth["type"]   = "ext";
$auth["prog"]   = "./badpw.pl";
$auth["params"] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";

NOTE: The last line are parameters that will get passed to the 'badpw.pl' script,
at runtime "#USERNAME#" and "#PASSWORD" will get replaced with the username and
password that the user entered to login.

Once you have changed this then look at the /mrbs/ page through your
browser. When you click one of the (+) buttons, you will be asked for a
username and password. Check badpw.pl for the valid combinations.

To try out an "admin" user, add an appropriate username to the section that
says:
   $auth["admin"][] = "....";

SMB Authentication
------------------

I haven't tried this method, so here are Sam Mason's instructions for using
his SMB authentication:

-------
As I said in the last mail, it uses an external program to do the
authentication, this is a very simple program, that returns "true" if the
username/password are valid and "false" otherwise.

Included is the source (smb_auth.c) to compile it download the "pam_smb"
library from some where that mirrors samba
(http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.samba.org/pam_smb/) copy the source into
the main source directory, and compile (having made the PAM library its
self) with something like.

gcc -o smb_auth smb_auth.c smbval/smbvalid.a

and copy the binary to somewhere useful I chose "/usr/bin/smb_auth"

[snip]

It requires the "smb_auth" program to be installed and working see
"config.inc.php" to use a different authentication program + set the servers +
domain used for the name checks.
-------

The config.inc.php entries he supplied were:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth["realm"]  = "MRBS";
$auth["type"]   = "ext";
$auth["prog"]   = "/usr/bin/smb_auth";
$auth["params"] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD# SERVER BACKUP DOMAIN";

The [params] are:
   * #USERNAME# is replaced by the actual username presented
   * #PASSWORD# is replaced by the user's password
   * Primary Server used for password validation
   * Secondary server used for password validation
   * NT domain under which the user is registered


Netware Authentication
----------------------
This is only going to work on Linux.

There's a program called "nwauth" which is included with ncpfs. To use it you'll
need to have IPX support compiled in your kernel. There might be other requirements as
well - see the stuff that comes with ncpfs.

You can get it from ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/

I've only tested this with ncpfs-2.2.0.18

Please see README.nwauth for more information on Netware authentication.


LDAP Authentication
-------------------
There are three methods for doing LDAP authentication currently, the preferable
method uses the LDAP functionalty built into PHP, to enable this change the
"$auth[type]" to "ldap" and check the the "$ldap_host" and "$ldap_base_dn"
entrys are correct in config.inc.php.  The program will check the username and
password pair with all the "$ldap_base_dn" entrys until one matches.

e.g.

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth["realm"]  = "MRBS";
$auth["type"]   = "ldap";
$auth["prog"]   = "";
$auth["params"] = "";

# The LDAP server is local
$ldap_host = "localhost";

# First search in the "People" then "Administrators" dn.
$ldap_base_dn[] = "ou=People, o=myCompany, c=US";
$ldap_base_dn[] = "ou=Administrators, o=myCompany, c=US";

The second LDAP authentication method uses a very small Perl program
 - ldap_auth.pl - It requires the Net::LDAP module be installed and working.
For me this simply meant doing:

   perl -MCPAN -e"install Net::LDAP"

The script simply attemps to bind to a server using a supplied dn and password.
It expects the full thing to be passed in - eg 

   cn=root, o=University of Michigan, c=us

In my case, I can pass just the cn and it works. My config.inc.php settings are:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth["realm"]  = "MRBS";
$auth["type"]   = "ext";
$auth["prog"]   = "/home/httpd/html/mrbs/auth_ldap.pl";
$auth["params"] = "LDAPSERVER cn=#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";


The third also uses a perl script that simply calls ldapsearch.
You will need specify the path to ldapsearch in auth_ldapsearch.pl
You might try this as a last resort if your site has an unusual
LDAP configuration.  NOTE, the script disallows any usernames which
contain uppercase or space characters in them, for the reason behind
this please see the script its self.

$auth["realm"]  = "MRBS";
$auth["type"]   = "ext";
$auth["prog"]   = "/home/httpd/html/mrbs/auth_ldapsearch.pl";
$auth["params"] = "LDAPSERVER cn=#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";
$auth["params"] = "YourServer \"Your search root\" \"#USERNAME#\" \"#PASSWORD#\"";

PAM Authentification
----------------------

In case your Unix system uses PAM (especially Linux, but also SUN Solaris)
you might try the script auth_pam.pl. This script takes two two parameters -
the user name  and the user password.

This perl script requires Authen::PAM.

The script has to be run as SUID. Therefore you should take some precautions
to not undermine your system's security. Change the group of the script to that
of your Web Server (for Apache this is normally nobody or apache) and don't
make it readable and executeable to anybody else, eg.:

chgrp nobody auth_pam.pl

The script has to be run SUID and has to be executed by sperl:

chmod 4750 auth_pam.pl

The first line (#!/usr/bin/sperl5.6.0) says where sperl is located on
your system. Please adapt this for your needs.

Now add the configuration to web/config.inc.php in your MRBS directory.
This looks as follows (adapt the path to auth_pam.pl according to your
your configuration):

$auth["realm"]  = "MY REALM";
$auth["type"]   = "ext";
$auth["prog"]   = "/var/www/html/mrbs/auth_pam.pl";
$auth["params"] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";

That's it.

Note that this has been oly tested with Red Hat 7.x. Feedback on whether
this works on other  systems ( eg. Solaris) is appreciated.


POP3 Authentication
-------------------

MRBS has POP3 Authentication support. This can be used by setting
config.inc.php as follows:

This provider will first try to authenticate using APOP, and fall back to
standard USER/PASS if that fails.

$auth["realm"]  = "MY REALM";
$auth["type"]   = "pop3";
$auth["prog"]   = "";
$auth["params"] = "";

Also you will need to change the section:

# 'auth_pop3' configuration settings
# Where is the POP3 server
$pop3_host = "pop3-server-name";
# The POP3 server port
$pop3_port = "110";

You will almost certainly not need to change the POP3 port number.


NT Authentication
-------------------

MRBS has Microsoft Windows NT authentication support. This can be used by 
setting config.inc.php as follows:

$auth["realm"]  = "";
$auth["type"]   = "nt";
$auth["prog"]   = "";
$auth["params"] = "";

To add an admin, just add his user's Windows user account like this:

   $auth["admin"][] = "nt_username";

Also this scheme is fairly simple (it relies on IIS determining a user's 
Windows user account identity, before allowing the user to establish a network 
connection with the server) there are some requirements for it to work (these
notes are based on IIS 5.0):

- You have to configure you mrbs directory (at least) to use either 
'Basic Authentication' or 'Integrated Windows Authentication' (formerly called 
NTLM or Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication).

To enable a WWW authentication method:

In the Internet Information Services snap-in, select your site, but preferably
only mrbs directory, and open its property sheets. 
Select the Directory Security property sheet. 
Under Anonymous Access and Authentication Control, click Edit. 
In the Authentication Methods dialog box, select one or more appropriate 
methods. 

The simplest way is to use 'Integrated Windows Authentication' because unlike 
'Basic authentication', it does not prompt users for a user name and password. 
The current Windows user information on the client computer is used for the 
'integrated Windows authentication'. 
It is also a more secure form of authentication because the user name and 
password are not sent across the network.

But if you really want your users to enter their domain username/password, you
have to select 'Basic Authentication'. The advantage of Basic authentication is 
that it is part of the HTTP specification, and is supported by most browsers. 
So, theoretically, you can log in with a valid domain username/password with a 
non-Microsoft browser, but frankly I did not tested it.
The disadvantage is that 'Basic authentication' transmit passwords in an 
unencrypted form.

- To use 'Integrated Windows Authentication', you HAVE TO use the Microsoft
browser too. Currently, only Internet Explorer, version 2.0 and later, supports 
this.

- The 'Anonymous access' must be disabled.

- If you enable both Basic and Integrated authentication, Integrated 
authentication takes precedence over Basic authentication.

- 'Integrated Windows authentication' does not work over HTTP Proxy connections 
or other firewall applications. So this scheme is more suitable for an 
Intranet, but 'Basic Authentication' should work (not tested). 

All this was tested against IIS 5.0 on Windows 2000 server and Windows 2000
workstations using Internet Explorer 6.0, but this should work from IIS 4.0.



OTHERS Authentication schemes provided
--------------------------------------

- IMAP Authentication.
- NAME Authentication is a slight variant of auth_ip. It tries to use the DNS 
  name to determine admin privileges instead of ip.
- NIS Authentication.
- OMNI Authentication using Omnicron OmniHTTPd web server security features.
- COOKIE Authentication for use with ROXEN web server.


Creating a new authentication scheme
------------------------------------

There are generic authentication functions in "mrbs_auth.inc", with functions
specific to a particular scheme in "auth_xxx.inc"

The "auth_xxx.inc" file needs to define certain functions:
   getAuth($realm)
      Request that the username/password be given for the specified realm

   authValidateUser($user, $pass)
      Checks if the specified username/password pair are valid

   authGetUserLevel($user)
      Determines the users access level

   getUserName()
      Returns the current user name
      
   getUserPassword()
      Retuens the current password
      
The "auth_ext.inc" file shows good examples of the use of these functions.

I think that the "ext" provider will be the most useful, because it can use
any external program to do the authentication.

For instance, to authenticate to an LDAP server, it would be relatively easy
to write a small program in [insert language of choice] which took
username, password and server name as parameters, and returned 0 for
"yes, this username/password is OK", and something else for "no, it's not".
The config.inc.php entries for this might look like:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION
$auth["realm"]  = "MRBS";
$auth["type"]   = "ext";
$auth["prog"]   = "/usr/bin/ldap_auth";
$auth["params"] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD# LDAP_SERVER";

"auth_ext.inc" constructs a command line to execute like:

   $cmd = $auth["prog"] . ' ' . $auth["params"];
   $cmd = preg_replace('/#USERNAME#/',$user,$cmd);
   $cmd = preg_replace('/#PASSWORD#/',$pass,$cmd);

This should allow a lot of flexibility with different authenticators.

The "auth_ip.inc" shows how it is possible to use any arbitrary value as the
"username" (in this case the value of $REMOTE_ADDR)


If you do create some new authentication provider, then please send it to
me and I'll include it in the main distribution.
