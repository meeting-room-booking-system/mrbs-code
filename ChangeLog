	  * Removed all terminating colons from the translations, moving
	  them to  the (arguably) correct place: the code.

	  * Added JavaScript and server side checking for setting of a
	  repeat day  if a booking requires one.

	  * Added server side checking for setting a valid n-weekly value.

	  * Emails sent by MRBS are now in UTF-8 (if $unicode_encoding is
	  1),  unless $mail_vocab is set to something else.

	  * Added Turkish support and translation, thanks to Ahmet YILDIZ.

	  * Removed possible infinite loop in n-weekly booking creation.

	  * Fixed invalid truncation of text in month.php, it could
	  truncate  descriptions mid-UTF8 sequence before.

	  * Added new auth method, imap_php, which authenticates via IMAP,
	  but  using the PHP 'imap' extension, which allows for SSL/TLS
	  connections.

	  * Upped version number to 1.2.6 in preparation for a release.

2008-01-28  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/auth_ldap.inc (tags: mrbs-1_2_6) (mrbs-1_2-branch.6): *
	  auth_ldap: Added support for searching the LDAP directory for the
	  full	DN to try and bind with. This allows for operation with
	  Microsoft AD	servers. Utilises new config variable
	  $ldap_dn_search_attrib, and  optionally $ldap_dn_search_dn (the
	  DN to bind with for the search) and  $ldap_dn_search_password
	  (the password to bind with). If $ldap_dn_search_dn  is set,
	  $ldap_dn_search_password MUST be set. NOTE: This is as yet
	  untested, as I don't currently have an MRBS test installation
	  that	can bind to an AD server for testing.

2008-01-28  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/auth_ldap.inc (mrbs-1_2-branch.5): * Detabbified (4 space
	  indent now) auth_ldap.inc, so it's easier to edit.   Only
	  whitespace changes.,

2007-09-07  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/edit_entry.php (mrbs-1_2-branch.6): * Fix for SF tracker

	  now correct.

2007-06-18  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/edit_entry.php (mrbs-1_2-branch.5): * Fixed HTML escaping
	  problem in edit_entry.php, the ENT_NOQUOTES  mode of

	  * Removed unnecessary table HTML tags in edit_area_room.php.
	  Fixes SF tracker #1696383, as reported by 'mikedip'.

	  * Fixed SQL escaping in edit_users.php, also required changes  to
	  pgsql.inc and mysqli.inc to fix the sql_field_type() function.

	  * i18n/l10n fixes in language.inc. Windows locale map
	  extended/fixed,  added Catalan support, improved the map the Unix

	* web/: month.php, version.inc (mrbs-1_2-branch.[4,2]) (utags:
	  mrbs-1_2_5): * Fixed a few bugs in month view, including double
	  escaping of the  < and > characters used in booking slot
	  descriptions (SF tracker  #1663905) and also the times were being
	  shown incorrectly, as  date() was being used instead of the now
	  standard (for anything  displayed to the user) utf8_strftime().

	  * Upped version to 1.2.5 in preparation for release.

2007-02-13  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/lang.sv (tags: mrbs-1_2_5) (mrbs-1_2-branch.3): * Got rid of

	  (mrbs-1_2-branch.[5,2,4,12,3,4,5,5,2,2,4,3,1,3,4,5,2]):
	  * LDAP auth scheme now has the ability to use LDAP v3 protocol,
	  and to use TLS, if configured to do so in config.inc.php.
	  Implements SF tracker #1644311.

	  * Fixed documentation of auth schemes in AUTHENTICATION to  not
	  mention the getUserPassword() function that is no  longer used.

	  * A few fixes to checklang.php.

	  * Added the ability to configure the cookie path that the  'php'
	  and 'cookie' session schemes use, to override  the
	  auto-determination these schemes use. Also made  the 'cookie'
	  session scheme actually use an expiring  cookie. Fixes SF tracker
	  #1515118.

	  * Removed all use of the utf8_date() function,  utf8_strftime()
	  is used instead. utf8_strftime() now	works around a bug in
	  strftime() in the handling of  %p, using date() if your locale
	  happens to return  empty strings for the %p substitution.

	  * Replaced a short php start tag in edit_entry_handler.php  with
	  the correct long form one. Fixes SF tracker #1652396.   Also
	  corrected a short start tag in lang.es.

	  * Added code into edit_entry_handler.php to support locales  that
	  use ',' as the decimal point. This will translate  "1,5" hours
	  into "1.5" so it is understood. Fixes SF tracker  #1647430.

	  * Added updated Swedish translation tokens, as provided  by
	  bwiberg.

	  * Added AIX support into language.inc. You can now run  MRBS on
	  an AIX server, in Unicode mode too. AIX support  provided (and
	  tested) by bwiberg.

	  * Backported the improved language preference code from  the
	  trunk MRBS development. The preference order of  languages
	  specified by a user is now acted upon.

	  * Corrected some bracketing in month.php, as reported  by a
	  number of people, including 't-matsuu' in SF tracker	#1644042
	  who provided a fix.

	  * Corrected CSS commenting in mrbs.css, as reported  in SF
	  tracker #1644042.

2007-01-24  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS (tags: mrbs-1_2_4) (mrbs-1_2-branch.5): * Updated NEWS and

	  Moved version number out of config.inc.php and into a
	  version.inc,	which provides a function to retrieve the version
	  number. Upped  version to 1.2.4.

2006-10-09  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	  (mrbs-1_2-branch.[4,3,10,2,4,4,2,2,2,2,1,4,2,1,1]):
	  * Added robots.txt and "Robots" META tag, to stop robots trawling
	   MRBS installations. Fixes SF bug tracker #1557192.

	  * Improved documentation in AUTHENTICATION on LDAP auth method
	  to make it clear that the 'ldap' PHP extension is required.
	  Fixes SF bug tracker #1554351.

	  * Fixes in auth_imap.inc to ensure that internet sockets to  the
	  IMAP server are closed, in an attempt to fix a report  in SF
	  tracker #1558451, though the reporter has since  told me my fixes
	  didn't help his problem...

	  * Fixed example setting of $ldap_filter in config.inc.php,  it
	  showed $ldap_user_filter instead of $ldap_filter.   Fixes SF bug
	  tracker #1550827.

	  * Added a little code to turn $month, $week and $day into
	  integers explicitly, before calling checkdate(), this  was
	  reported under SF tracker #1557192 as a place  where MRBS will
	  output warnings (when being trawled  by GoogleBot).

	  * Added a check in edit_entry_handler.php to ensure  that the
	  "Brief Description" is not empty. This will  only happen if the
	  user doesn't have JavaScript turned  on, as usually there is
	  JavaScript validation that you  enter a description. Translators
	  note that I had to  add two more vocab tokens.

	  * Tidied HTML formatting - just the header section (for now).

	  * Added updated Finnish translation as provided by Tom  Ingberg
	  in SF tracker #1450459. The translation encoding  has changed to
	  UTF-8, so anyone with a Finnish installation	that sets
	  $unicode_encoding to 1 will need to run  convert_db_to_utf8.php
	  to convert the text in  their database from iso-8859-1 to UTF-8.

	  * A few fixes to mysqli.inc that I'd not spotted in my  earlier
	  testing.

	  * A fix in session_php.inc to ensure that the user's password
	  gets unslashed(). Fixed SF bug tracker #1563470.

	  * A few changes in trailer.inc so that the current day/week/month
	   in the trailer links are highlighted somewhat. Implements  SF
	  feature request tracker # 875744.

2006-07-07  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/lang.es (tags: mrbs-1_2_4) (mrbs-1_2-branch.1): * Updated
	  Spanish translation, as provided by SoTMaR.

2006-07-07  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	  web/mysqli.inc (mrbs-1_2-branch.[2,1,1,9,1]): * Added 'mysqli'
	  database abstraction, to allow PHP 5 installations  to use the
	  newer/better 'mysqli' extension instead of 'mysql'.	Reasonably
	  tested on a Linux Apache 2.2.0/MySQL 5.0.18/PHP 5.1.2
	  installation. Updated the documentation to mention the new
	  database   abstraction method, hopefully in all the necessary
	  places.

2006-04-26  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/config.inc.php (mrbs-1_2-branch.8): * Fixed typo in comment

	  Upped version number to 1.2.3+cvs (rather belatedly)

	  * Fixed some HTML escaping issues in the grids.

	  * Fixed a problem whereby non-repeating entries wouldn't  be
	  emailed to area/room admins. Fixes SF tracker #1474386,  fix
	  provided by 'karcher'.

	  * Added a little error logging into email functionality.   You
	  should get an diagnostic error in your error log if	an email
	  fails to be sent.

	  * Fixed zh-tw translation to correctly specify its encoding as
	  utf-8.

	  * Improved get_vocab() so that it doesn't do an iconv if the
	  language  encoding is utf-8.

	  * Fixed bug in report.php that meant the meeting end date was
	  shown  when the start date should have been. This fix was
	  provided to me  somehow, but I can't find who provided it...

	  * Added "remote_user" session scheme, as provided by 'bwiberg' on
	   SF tracker #1432748. Allows MRBS to be configured to use a
	  server authentication scheme that sets the REMOTE_USER
	  environment  variable.

	  Allow more entry types, now A-Z instead of A-J.

	  * Fix in notifyAdminOnBooking, to fix SF tracker #1315854,  as
	  supplied by Neville Gilbert. The fix ensures that the  area
	  administrator is sent an email when a booking is  created.

	  * Improve server OS detection in language.inc. SunOS is now
	  handled, including utf-8 locale support.

	  * Improved n-weekly repeat code, you can now do an n-weekly
	  repeating  meeting that happens on a sunday. Calculation of which
	  days to  create bookings on is now done more carefully. SF
	  tracker #1300974

	  * Updated Swedish translation, as provided by Bjorn Wiberg in SF
	  tracker #1397719.

	  * Fixed problem in report.php that would create an error if MRBS
	  was  configured to use HTTP session handling and you clicked the
	  "You are ..." link. Provided by Bjorn Wiberg in SF tracker
	  #1396685.

2005-09-02  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	  change the port of the LDAP server when  the 'ldap' auth scheme
	  is used. Set $ldap_port in config.inc.php  to change from the
	  default port.  * Added documentation for ldap port configuration
	  into	AUTHENTICATION, along with some brief details on the 'nis'
	  auth scheme.	* Tidied up some of the text in INSTALL describing
	  MRBS's i18n  and l10n support.  * Made checklang.php work with
	  register_globals off, and made the  output prettier.	* Fixed a
	  typo in a comment in config.inc.php * Added a missing $ in a
	  Finnish vocab entry.

	  (mrbs-1_2-branch.3): * Bug fix for the SQL statement that
	  generates the mrbs_users table.   Autoincrement columns don't
	  need a DEFAULT, and if specified with   one on MySQL >= 4.1 the
	  SQL statement fails. The DEFAULT clause has	been removed from
	  the SQL.

2005-08-31  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	  (mrbs-1_2-branch.[1,3,2,5,2,2,1]):
	  * Improved db_ext auth scheme - moved the configuration into
	  config.inc.php,  where it belongs. Additionally added support for
	  the password in the  external database being in different
	  formats, namely one of:    - MD5    - SHA1	- crypt    -
	  plaintext   Also documented the scheme in AUTHENTICATION, and
	  added example config	in config.inc.php.

	  * Fixes for cookie and php session schemes, username and password
	  as  obtained from the web form are now 'unslashed' before being
	  stored  and/or passed to the auth scheme.  auth_db.inc updated to
	  escape the  username being putting it in the database query.

	  * Added site_faq_es.html, contributed by Carlos Insunza.

	* web/: edit_users.php, lang.en (mrbs-1_2-branch.[2,1]) (utags:
	  mrbs-1_2_3): * A few improvements to db authentication system:
	  - mrbs_users table is now created with a 40 character wide
	  password     column. Used to be 32 which was only just enough.
	  This matches the     column width I made the trunk development
	  MRBS use.    - A message is now shown at the top of the edit
	  users page when      the mrbs_users table is empty that describes
	  the situation and what      to do.	- After a user entry is
	  updated we now redirect the web browser back	    to the edit
	  users page, to discard the form arguments.

2005-05-11  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-05-11  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/auth_db_ext.inc (mrbs-1_2-branch.1): * Added new
	  authentication scheme, a result of support request 1199314.	It
	  queries a table in an external database for username/password
	  information. It's mysql only, and assumes the password is stored
	  in   plaintext. Config values must be changed at the top of the
	  file too.

	  * Improved auth system, the session code doesn't need to return
	  the user password any more, and getAuthorised() now only requires
	   one parameter.

	  * session_cookie.inc now deletes the cookie when the user logs
	  out.	 User password isn't stored in a cookie any more, which is

	  * session_php.inc now creates a session for the directory MRBS is
	   run from, instead of assuming '/'. Additionally, session data is

2004-06-15  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/month.php (1.30): Changed main table formatting to match day
	  and week view tables.

2004-06-15  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/mrbs.css (1.10): Changed background-color and border-color
	  for TH elements so that in day and week view the links in the
	  header cells of the tables are more readable.

2004-06-15  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/mrbs.css (1.9): Changed default colour for odd row
	  (TD.odd_row) so that it is not the same as the default colour for
	  TD.J

2004-06-14  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/session_cookie.inc (1.9, mrbs-post-MDB-merge,
	  mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp):
	  Fixes problem identifed by Dane where an invalid user will appear
	  to be logged in.  This was caused by the cookie being set and no
	  validation of the user being done because the wrong variables
	  were being used.  This is not a security issue.

2004-06-14  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.36, mrbs-1_2_3, mrbs-1_2_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_lastmerge,
	  mrbs-1_2_1), web/config.inc.php (1.39) (utags: mrbs-1_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_bp): Changed comment about $url_base to recommend
	  setting this if email notifications are to be used.

	  Fixed Bug 972186

2004-06-13  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/functions_mail.inc (1.10): - $endtime is declared as a global
	  in notifyAdminOnBooking but it is   modified by being used as a
	  "local" variable - renamed the "local" variable   Fixes bug
	  #968682

	  - use rep_type as more accurate indication of series or not, so
	  that	 $myendtime can be set the most appropriate value.

2004-06-12  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	  mrbs-1_2-branch_lastmerge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_bp): Changing ordering of rooms in day view back
	  to "by room name" as "by capacity" was specific to Jean-François'
	  implementation.

	  mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp),
	  config.inc.php (1.38): Update auth_ldap.inc and config.inc.php.
	  - LDAP servers may not allow anon. bind so this broke the
	  previous version of auth_ldap.inc.  I have removed the attempt at
	  an anon. bind and have given the admin more control over the dn
	  that an auth. bind is attempted with.

	  - the user attribute can be defined individually for each base dn
	  if reequired.

	  - $ldap_base_dn and $ldap_usesr_attrib are handled in a similar
	  way to imap and pop3, server and port, definitions, and
	  config.inic.php has been updated to reflect this.

2004-05-27  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

2004-05-12  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	  set.

2004-05-12  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/functions_mail.inc (1.7): - (sendMail()): forgot to add the

	  recipients list.

2004-05-11  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

2004-05-11  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/language.inc (1.11, mrbs-1-2-pre3): Removed notice in case

2004-05-08  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.33), web/config.inc.php (1.35),
	  web/edit_entry_handler.php (1.20), web/functions_mail.inc (1.5),
	  web/language.inc (1.10): + Enhancements to email support: added

	  am.  Default value is 0.

2004-05-06  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/day.php (1.35): Modified so that capacity is not displayed in
	  brackets next to room name if capacity is 0.	This helps where
	  the "room" is a piece of equipment or a person.  Thanks to
	  Michael Hellwig.

2004-05-06  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: day.php (1.34), week.php (1.36): Modified week and day to
	  be consistent in the way that they are displayed normally and in
	  print preview if no area/room is defined.

2004-05-06  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

2004-05-05  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: edit_area_room.php (1.13), functions_mail.inc (1.3): *

	  details)   - Configurable option to decide the lang used in
	  emails and the text of     subject and body.	 - Configurable
	  options to decide which events cause an email to be sent
	  (whether only new entries, new and edited entries, or deleted

	  three mail backends:	   either the php mail function, an
	  external smtp server (with or without     authentication) or unix
	  sendmail program.   - upgraded Net::Socket from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2

2004-04-29  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/lang.fi (1.8, mrbs-1-2-pre3): Updated lang.fi (thanks Tom

2004-04-27  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/edit_entry.php (1.28): Need to escape double-quotes in room

2004-04-27  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/functions.inc (1.31): added double-quotes around minutes as:

	  index" - quote from PHP manual.  Thanks Thierry

2004-04-25  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: edit_users.php (1.8), mysql.inc (1.5, mrbs-1_2_6,
	  mrbs-1_2_5, mrbs-1_2_4, mrbs-1_2_3, mrbs-1_2_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_lastmerge, mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1,
	  mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3), pgsql.inc (1.6,

	  mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3): Modified the way
	  edit_users.php gets the user table fields names and types.  It
	  now uses the three new routines sql_field_name, sql_field_type,
	  sql_num_fields, defined in mysql.inc and pgsql.inc, which in turn
	  call their corresponding database-specific eponym.  Still not
	  tested with PostgreSQL, but much more likely to work.

2004-04-25  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: day.php (1.33), lang.en (1.23), lang.fr (1.21), month.php
	  (1.29, mrbs-1-2-pre3), week.php (1.35), xbLib.js (1.3,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre3): Localize the message displayed on the status bar
	  when a cell is activated under the cursor.  The string is defined
	  as $vocab["click_to_reserve"] in lang.xx.  It is passed from PHP
	  to JavaScript as an additional argument to routine
	  InitActiveCell().

2004-04-18  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: day.php (1.32), month.php (1.28), mrbs.css (1.8,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre3), week.php (1.34), xbLib.js (1.2): Added active
	  highlighting of the month view cells.  This required an
	  additional parameter in InitActiveCell(), hence the minor changes
	  in the day and week views.  Side effect of this change: The (+)
	  sign in the month view is moved after the list of reservations,
	  instead of before. This was necessary, else the list itself was
	  moved to the bottom of the cell, which did not look good.

2004-04-18  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: month.php (1.27), week.php (1.33): Include mrbs_auth.inc to

	* web/lang.el (1.3, mrbs-1-2-pre3): Doc fix (it is a greek file,
	  not english)

2004-04-16  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: day.php (1.31), week.php (1.32): I have changed the day and
	  week view so that the colour key is shown in both the "web page"
	  view and "print preview".  I believe that it makes sense to
	  include the key in the "print preview" version so that you can
	  understand the colours on a hardcopy.

2004-04-16  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	  mrbs-1-2-pre3), web/Net/Socket.php (1.1): + Added email support

	  function sendMail(), with at least the minimal parameters
	  ($recipients, $subject and $body) to send mail from MRBS.  +
	  Added the option to notify the administrator (or someone else)

2004-04-15  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/auth_db.inc (1.6, mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3): - (authValidateUser): add
	  global $tbl_users;

2004-04-14  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.28): Added instructions about using table name prefix
	  to allow second installations or resolve table name conflicts.

2004-04-14  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* destroy.pg.sql (1.3, mrbs-1_2_6, mrbs-1_2_5, mrbs-1_2_4,

	  mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre3): Changed the fixed table names to variables.  The
	  variables are defined in config.inc.php.

2004-04-14  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/config.inc.php (1.30): Added variables to allow the 'mrbs_'
	  prefix on table names to be changed.	This will allow the user to
	  do a second installation when only one database is available or
	  resolve table name conflicts.

2004-04-14  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/day.php (1.29): - Correct the \\n new line character in
	  tooltips to &#10; . Currently it changes nothing but the HTML
	  spec says \\n in titles should be converted to spaces. So, the
	  current thoughts of the Mozilla developers is that &#10; would
	  insert a line break in a title, and a literal \\n would not, but
	  they've not implemented it yet though.  However, IE _does_
	  currently work with &#10; and that method seems to fit the specs
	  much more closely. (John Beranek)

2004-04-14  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/config.inc.php (1.29): Corrected the errors pointed out by
	  Thierry.  (Missing change from his last commit, and
	  authentication default changed by mistake)

2004-04-14  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/functions.inc (1.28):
	  * Slight Unicode fix. Move page title specifier to _after_  page
	  encoding specifier. That way the browser knows what  encoding the
	  title is in before it gets to it.

2004-04-14  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: config.inc.php (1.28), day.php (1.28), mrbs.css (1.7),
	  week.php (1.30), xbLib.js (1.1): Added an optional active cell
	  highlighting, and the ability to make a reservation by clicking
	  anywhere in a cell.  The control is done in config.inc.php.
	  Default is highlighting enabled; + signs left in.  The highligth
	  color is defined in mrbs.css.

	  Changed the background stripe generation method. Now defined be
	  classes in mrbs.css.

2004-04-14  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/language.inc (1.8): Fixed error when the server does not
	  define $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE.

2004-04-13  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.27), web/config.inc.php (1.27): + Doc fix.

2004-04-13  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: config.inc.php (1.26), month.php (1.25): + Added the option
	  to show both time slots and brief description.

2004-04-13  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/report.php (1.20): + Added the 'creator' search criteria.

2004-04-12  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/day.php (1.27): added '' to minicals function call for room
	  parameter as room is not relevant in day context

2004-04-12  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: month.php (1.24), week.php (1.29): added $room to minicals
	  function call

2004-04-12  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/mrbs.css (1.6): added class for highlighting current
	  month/week/day in calendars, used in mincals.inc

2004-04-12  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/mincals.inc (1.11, mrbs-1_2_6, mrbs-1_2_5, mrbs-1_2_4,
	  mrbs-1_2_3, mrbs-1_2_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_lastmerge,
	  mrbs-post-MDB-merge, mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3): mincal changes: - correct
	  week highlight code to correctly highlight where a week crosses
	  into a new month.  The problem was when crossing the year
	  boundary, and   where only the last day of the week was in the
	  new month and the number   of days in the current month was < 31.
	  - week and month now include room in the link thus maintaining
	  the same   room when using the calendars for navigation -
	  highlights whole month in month view - highlight colour moved to
	  mrbs.css

2004-04-11  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: auth_db.inc (1.4), session_cookie.inc (1.8, mrbs-1-2-pre3),
	  session_php.inc (1.8, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre3): + Add link to user entries for all auth schemes,
	  not only db (thanks Gavin!).

2004-04-11  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/month.php (1.23): Added 'plus sign' next to date in month
	  view.

	  This will take the user to an add entry page for that day of the
	  month.

2004-04-11  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: auth_db.inc (1.3), lang.en (1.21), lang.fr (1.20),
	  report.php (1.19), session_cookie.inc (1.7), session_php.inc
	  (1.7): + If auth_db is used with session_cookie or session_php,
	  the message "you are XXXX" becomes a link to all upcoming entries
	  belonging to XXXX (report page). If auth_db is not used, the
	  previous empty HREF link "you are XXXX" is useless and is now a
	  simple text message.

2004-04-10  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/edit_users.php (1.6): - Changed the title displayed when
	  adding new user from 'Edit user' to 'Add a new user'.

2004-04-10  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: auth_db.inc (1.2), edit_users.php (1.5): + Hashes passwords
	  in dababase (auth_db). Update 'password' field for this purpose.

2004-04-10  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: lang.cz (1.7, mrbs-1-2-pre3), lang.da (1.4, mrbs-1-2-pre3),
	  lang.de (1.15), lang.el (1.2), lang.en (1.20), lang.es (1.17,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre3), lang.fi (1.7), lang.fr (1.19), lang.it (1.10,

	  mrbs-1-2-pre3), lang.sv (1.15), lang.zh-tw (1.14, mrbs-1-2-pre3),
	  month.php (1.22), report.php (1.18), view_entry.php (1.13),
	  week.php (1.28): Removed punctuation from $vocab["room"]  string
	  so that this vocab can be used more often and lessen the number
	  of vocabs (replace $vocab["sort_rep_room"]). This could be done
	  in all vocabs too, as a general rule we should not use
	  punctuation and other things not related to translation in these
	  strings.

2004-04-09  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION (1.26), web/auth_imap.inc (1.6,
	  mrbs-post-MDB-merge, mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3), web/auth_pop3.inc (1.6,
	  mrbs-post-MDB-merge, mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3), web/config.inc.php (1.25):
	  This change allows multiple pop3 or imap server to be used for
	  authentication.

	  AUTHENTICATION has been updated to explain this and users are
	  referred to AUTHENTICATION from config.inc.php if they wish to
	  use multiple servers.

2004-04-08  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: functions.inc (1.27), lang.en (1.19), report.php (1.17):
	  This includes an update to reporting to allow reports to be
	  sorted by Area/Room then Start Date/Time or Start Date/Time then
	  Area/Room.

	  There is also now the option to display Start and End date/time
	  instead of start date/time and duration.

	  A modification has been made to period_date_string in
	  functions.inc to make the display start/end dates and periods
	  clearer.

2004-04-07  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION (1.25), INSTALL (1.26), web/config.inc.php (1.24):
	  Doc fixes (added DB doc)

2004-04-07  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/config.inc.php (1.23): Updating mrbs version number before
	  next release :-)

2004-04-07  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: month.php (1.21), week.php (1.27): ChangeLog update Doc
	  fixes.

2004-04-05  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: lang.el (1.1), style.inc (1.10, mrbs-pre-MDB-merge,
	  mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3):
	  * Added Greek translation, lang.el

	  * Fixed global variable problem in style.inc, $vocab wasn't
	  being declared as a global.

	  [Translation and fix provided by Stavros Papadakis]

2004-03-24  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.25): Doc fix

2004-03-15  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: month.php (1.20), functions.inc (1.26), week.php (1.26):
	  This change means that the default room in an area, if none is
	  specified or when changing areas will be the first listed rather
	  than the room with the lowest id.

	  This also affects the choice of area if no room or area is
	  specified then the first listed area will be chosen rather than
	  the one with the lowest id.

2004-03-15  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: index.php (1.7), config.inc.php (1.22): Added configuration
	  option to allow index.php to redirect to a specific room.

2004-03-10  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: day.php (1.26), week.php (1.25): Added specific Room
	  Description showing with a pop up/hover title for each room  on
	  the week view link in day.php and room link in week.php. (Valeria
	  Montesi/Gareth T).

2004-03-08  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/edit_users.php (1.4): The last change, to restrict access to
	  the page to identified users, broke the ability to initially
	  enter the first user! Fixed this by avoiding to do this test if
	  the user list is empty. Actually moved the code to a branch that
	  already ran only if the user list was not empty.

2004-02-27  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/mrbs_sql.inc (1.15): (mrbsCheckFree): - corrected 'undefined
	  variable' bug (typo on variable name line 54, $enable_period
	  instead of $enable_periods)

2004-02-11  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/index.php (1.6): - included grab_globals.inc.php at the top
	  of the file otherwise  $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is undefined

2004-02-04  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: mrbs_sql.inc (1.14), report.php (1.16):
	  * Removed 3 uses of %T format specifier in strftime() calls,	as
	  it seems Windows strftime() doesn't support %T. Tested  on a
	  Windows MRBS (Apache + MySQL) installation. Problem  reported by
	  Reinhold Petrich on the mailing list, and fix  also confirmed.

2004-02-04  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/mincals.inc (1.10): Use basename($PHP_SELF) to avoid false
	  hits, if the substrings "day" or "week" or "month" appear in the
	  full URL.

2004-02-02  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/functions.inc (1.25):
	  * Fixed JavaScript in functions.inc (for area and room  drop-down
	  menus in day/week/month view) to use relative  URLs, and better
	  "onChange" handling.

2004-01-31  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/language.inc (1.7): Updated the iconv error message, based on
	  the suggestion by David Watts.

2004-01-31  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/edit_users.php (1.3): Make sure the user is authenticated
	  before giving him access to the list.

2004-01-28  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: index.php (1.5), config.inc.php (1.21): Added $default_view
	  as suggested by Warren Turkal This can be used to determine the
	  default starting view, i.e. month, week or day, as used by
	  index.php.

2004-01-27  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/report.php (1.15): BUG 885333 - fixed - added check to ensure
	  that $typematch_default is an array.

2004-01-26  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/edit_entry.php (1.26): When the user clicks on the "All day"
	  checkbox, use JavaScript to immediately change the time to 00:00
	  and the duration to 1 day.  (Designed for support of periods too,
	  but not tested)

2004-01-22  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/edit_users.php (1.2): Removed the paragliding-specific weight
	  field :-)

2004-01-22  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: config.inc.php (1.20), day.php (1.25): Added the ability to
	  display horizontal bands of color in the background of the day
	  view, to make the table more readable.  This is enabled by
	  changing the new setting $stripe_color in config.inc.php. This
	  value sets the color class for the bands.  "white"= no bands
	  (default) For example changing it to "J" display light gray
	  bands.

2004-01-22  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.24): Previous commit truncated file - adding back in
	  missing lines

2004-01-22  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: config.inc.php (1.19), day.php (1.24), lang.cz (1.6),
	  lang.da (1.3), lang.de (1.14), lang.en (1.18), lang.es (1.16),

	  lang.nl (1.14), lang.no (1.11), lang.pt (1.3), lang.sv (1.14),
	  lang.zh-tw (1.13), week.php (1.24): + Option to display times on
	  right side in day and week view.  + pop-up messages

2004-01-21  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: lang.en (1.17), report.php (1.14): Allows reports to be
	  limited to certain reservation types (eg just 'external').  This
	  is multiple select box.  If all are selected or none are selected
	  then all reservation types are included in the report.

2004-01-21  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.23), web/config.inc.php (1.18), web/day.php (1.23),
	  web/edit_entry.php (1.25), web/edit_entry_handler.php (1.16),
	  web/functions.inc (1.24), web/lang.en (1.16), web/month.php
	  (1.19), web/mrbs_sql.inc (1.13), web/report.php (1.13),
	  web/search.php (1.11), web/view_entry.php (1.12), web/week.php
	  (1.23): This update contains all of the code and documentation to
	  support "periods" within mrbs.

2004-01-20  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/day.php (1.22): + Added link to rooms heading to display the
	  weekly view for that room.

2004-01-19  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: auth_db.inc (1.1), config.inc.php (1.17), edit_users.php
	  (1.1), lang.en (1.15), lang.fr (1.17), mrbs.css (1.5),
	  session_cookie.inc (1.6), session_php.inc (1.6): Added a new
	  authentication module auth_db.inc.  This is a web-based
	  authentication, based on a new table of users in the mrbs
	  database. Implements RFE #665239 "Multiuser, Web based auth".
	  Added module edit_users.php to manage the contents of this table.
	  New English and French strings added in lang.en and lang.fr
	  respectively.  Added in session_php.inc and session_cookie.inc
	  logon box an optional link to the user list management page.
	  Finally minor changes to config.inc.php (comment) and mrbs.css
	  (style for buttons inside tables).

2004-01-15  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/language.inc (1.6): Updated the error message displayed in
	  the case where the iconv extension is missing.

2004-01-15  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: config.inc.php (1.16), session_cookie.inc (1.5),
	  session_php.inc (1.5), trailer.inc (1.10, mrbs-1_2_3, mrbs-1_2_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_lastmerge, mrbs-post-MDB-merge,
	  mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre3): Changed absolute paths in anchor hrefs and
	  redirection headers from absolute to relative.  This should fix
	  the link failures seen by some users, in environments where a
	  proxy makes the user-visible root different from the
	  web-server-visible root.  In the unlikely case where some users
	  have a very old browser not supporting relative HTTP relocation
	  headers, then they can use the $url_base in config.inc.php as a

	  the MRBS root, as seen by the users through the proxy.

2004-01-15  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/month.php (1.18): - Fixed bug [ 875782 ]: Month View, Extra
	  carriage return.  Text formating problem if
	  $monthly_view_brief_description set to TRUE.

2004-01-11  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/mrbs.css (1.4): Added a directive to avoid having a blank
	  line below buttons inside tables. This makes the logon cell in
	  the top banner, and the forthcoming user properties editor page,
	  look much better.

2004-01-11  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.22): Doc fix: unlike Apache on Windows, you HAVE to
	  copy iconv.dll in into \\%windir%\\system32\\ if you use
	  Microsoft IIS.

2004-01-09  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/config.inc.php (1.15):
	  * The MRBS version number hadn't been updated to 1.2-pre2.   It
	  has now.

2003-12-22  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: edit_entry.php (1.24), lang.en (1.14): Added support for
	  changing area/room in Add/Edit entry form.  Added check to ensure
	  that at least one room is selected as edit_entry_handler.php does
	  not catch this.  Added wording to lang.en to cover the above
	  check.

	  The first fix requires that javascript is enabled.  If it is not
	  then you get the same form as you get currently.  If it is
	  enabled and you have more than one area then you get an area
	  select box which controls the rooms displayed in the room select
	  box.

2003-12-22  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/day.php (1.21): Minor formatting fix for day view when viewed
	  with Konqueror.

2003-12-21  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION (1.24), INSTALL (1.21), README (1.13, mrbs-1_2_3,

	  mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3),
	  web/functions.inc (1.23): Doc fix: - Updated other doc areas
	  about default administrator since JFL change.  - Removed warning
	  in function.inc since it works now with Gavin changes

2003-12-21  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/config.inc.php (1.14): Changed the default administrator
	  list, to be coherent with the explanations in AUTHENTICATION, and
	  also to work out-of-the-box.

2003-12-21  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION (1.23): Added a few comments from last weeks
	  emails on the list.  Changed the information about the default
	  administrator settings, which was incoherent with the default
	  contents of config.inc.php.

2003-12-17  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/functions.inc (1.22): Modified Javascript to work with
	  Mozilla 1.5 (Linux) and NS4 (Linux), also tested with Konqueror
	  3.1.4 and IE 6.0

	  Days now work for all changes of Month and Year.

	  Added JavaScript to fix days once date selector is displayed so
	  that if a month has < 31 days then the day selector is shortened
	  appropriately.

2003-12-17  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/auth_ldap.inc (1.6, mrbs-1-2-pre3): (authValidateUser): -
	  Tried to fix LDAP servers login processes waiting for 'uid' and
	  not for 'cn'.  Does an anonymous bind first, tries to find  the
	  dn for the user and then binds to it with $pass.  (Bernd Oeggl ,
	  Philippe Schwarz).

2003-12-17  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/config.inc.php (1.13): - Fix URL problems when using a proxy
	  in the environment.

2003-12-14  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/functions.inc (1.21): (print_header): Added JavaScript to
	  insure the integrity of the date entered in three field drop-down
	  menus.

	       Tested with Windows IE 6.0
	       Tested with Linux Opera 7.21, Mozilla 1.3, Konqueror 3.1.0

	       WARNING: little bug in Mozilla 1.3. If a month with less
	  than 31 days is
	       selected, the max days number is updated correctly, but if
	  you select
	       a 31 days month again, then max days number is not updated
	  (ie. stays at
	       30 or 28). Goto a 31 days month to have the 31 days back.
	  Since Mozilla
	       1.3 is rather not up to date (1.6b current at 2003-11-15),
	  this may be
	       corrected in newer releases.

2003-12-12  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/admin.php (1.15, mrbs-1-2-pre2): - Fixed bug #846337: We can
	  create rooms with no area

2003-12-03  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: day.php (1.20, mrbs-1-2-pre2), edit_entry.php (1.22),
	  edit_entry_handler.php (1.14), functions.inc (1.20,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre2), month.php (1.17, mrbs-1-2-pre2), mrbs_sql.inc
	  (1.12, mrbs-1-2-pre2), view_entry.php (1.11, mrbs-1-2-pre2),
	  week.php (1.22, mrbs-1-2-pre2): Daylight Saving Time fixes.

	  This has involved modifying month.php, week.php and day.php,
	  view_entry.php, edit_entry.php, edit_entry_handler.php,
	  mbs_sql.inc and functions.inc

	  For month.php and week.php, I have changed them to handle each
	  week/month on a day by day basis.  They and day.php make DST
	  corrections for the start and end of each day.  The intervals of
	  time are handled by using the format HHMM with no leading zeros.
	  Events are read in to an array using this format of time as the
	  one of the indices.  A day which does not include a DST change is
	  used to loop through all valid hours for that day.

	  The view_entry.php has been altered to modify times that cross
	  DST back to what the user would expect 9pm to 3am is 6 hours but
	  it is stored as either 5 or 7 hours.

	  The edit_entry.php, edit_entry_handler.php and mrbs_sql.inc have
	  been changed to correctly calculate the difference between two
	  timestamps and correct the end time for checking the following:
	  free time, all day events and repeating events.

	  functions.inc includes two new functions: one to check for DST
	  and one to correct for DST.  These are used in the fixes above.

	  Where possible, calculations that used to use midnight have been
	  changed to use midday to avoid DST problems.

	  You may still see some "strange" but correct behaviour when
	  scheduling meetings which start and/or end between midnight and 3
	  am on a day of DST.  These may look wrong but should actually be
	  correct if you consider how DST works on that day, i.e in the UK
	  the hour from 1am to 2pm does not exist when entering DST.

	  Backward compatibility: There may be a one hour error for events
	  that start or end between midnight and 3am on the day that DST
	  changes but these can be fixed by editting the entry/series and
	  saving it.

2003-12-03  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.17), README (1.11), tables.pg.73and_above.sql (1.1,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre2): ° Updated documentation about new authentication
	  features.  ° Updated documentation to add warnings about mrbs not
	  working with postegreSQL version 7.3 and above.

	  Mrbs does not work anymore with postgreSQL dbms since pgsql
	  version 7.3.	This is because the following changes :     - An
	  empty string ('') is no longer allowed as the input into an
	  integer field. Formerly, it was silently interpreted as 0. If you
	  want	     a field to be 0 then explicitly use 0, if you want it
	  to be undefined	then use NULL.	    - "INSERT" statements
	  with column lists must specify all values;	    e.g., INSERT
	  INTO tab (col1, col2) VALUES ('val1') is now invalid.

	  This is a problem since we have to change all sql logic that
	  works fine with mysql just to be compliant with postGreSQL. Since
	  nobody reported this error, I can thinks mrbs users using pgsql
	  are very few.  Currently the new tables.pg.73and_above.sql file
	  allow to create mrbs tables with new postgreSQL versions, but is
	  experimental.  You can still browse existing mrbs tables with new
	  versions, but you cannot add/edit entries/rooms/areas any more.

2003-12-03  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pgsql.before_php42.inc (1.1, mrbs-1_2_6, mrbs-1_2_5, mrbs-1_2_4,

	  mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre3), web/pgsql.inc (1.5) (utags: mrbs-1-2-pre2):
	  Updated the postgreSql driver (pgsql.inc) to remove deprecated
	  functions. People which still use a php version less than 4.2
	  will have to replace the existing pgsql.inc file with
	  pgsql.before_php42.inc file and rename it to pgsql.inc

2003-12-01  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION (1.19): Complete rewrite of the file in html.
	  Converted to text using detagger
	  (http://www.jafsoft.com/detagger/)

2003-11-24  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	  mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre2): Since we always forgot for each release to update
	  mrbs version in help.php (this is not a file we open often), I
	  moved the variable to config.inc.php.

2003-11-21  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/session_cookie.inc (1.4, mrbs-1-2-pre2): - fixed not working

	  mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre2): Created an auth_none.inc authentication, which
	  validates any user.  Moved session management code from the old
	  auth_ip, auth_name, auth_nt, auth_omni to the new session_ip,
	  session_host, session_nt, session_omni respectively.	Updated
	  config.inc.php comments to reflect the possible choices for

2003-11-18  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/language.inc (1.5, mrbs-1-2-pre2): Updated the administrator

	  mrbs-1-2-pre3), web/style.inc (1.9) (utags: mrbs-1-2-pre2):
	  * Added utility to convert text in the database to UTF8, to  use
	  MRBS with $unicode_encoding set to 1. The administrator  should
	  copy it into the web directory, run it (choosing  the encoding to
	  convert from) ONCE, and then move it back out of  the web
	  directory.

	  * Added comment to my usage of $vocab["charset"] in style.inc, as
	   ist doesn't match the general usage of get_vocab().

2003-11-17  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/config.inc.php (1.9): Removed unnecessary comment.

2003-11-17  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/admin.php (1.14): - make admin.php working with error level

2003-11-14  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/day.php (1.19): Moved inclusion of mrbs_auth.inc after that

	  one eventually.

2003-11-14  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	  Moved routines authGet(), getUserName() and getUserPassword() to

2003-11-14  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: session_cookie.inc (1.2), session_php.inc (1.3): Moved
	  $HTTP_HOST setting to grab_globals.inc.  Added missing globals
	  declarations.  Removed the argument to authGet().  Action
	  "SetName" now validates the user/password pair. This avoids
	  loging on unauthorized users, which would rejected later on.

2003-11-14  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

2003-11-09  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/language.inc (1.4): Display an error message when the iconv

	  slots with an entry now display bubbles when mouse over, showing

	  short name or start-stop time in month view in accordance with
	  $_MRBS_monthly_view_brief_description value in config.inc.php.

2003-11-01  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/week.php (1.20): Fixing typos

2003-10-31  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.16), web/config.inc.php (1.6): Added warning to avoid
	  specify calendar settings that displays blocks overlaping the
	  next day, since it is not properly handled.

2003-10-31  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/language.inc (1.3): - Fixing a bug if we override local in
	  config.inc.php. Variable name was called $override_locale in
	  config file and $locale_override in language.inc.

2003-10-31  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/week.php (1.19): - Fixing The Daylight Savings Time bug
	  (thanks to Tony Fugere (tonyfugere at users.sourceforge.net)).

2003-10-31  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/auth_pop3.inc (1.4): - getting auth_pop3 working even in
	  error_reporting(ALL).

2003-10-11  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testdata.php (1.4, mrbs-1-2-pre2): - bug fix: Make testdata
	  compliant to register_global=off (samples entries had no authors)

2003-10-10  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/language.inc (1.2): - Changed getenv('HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE')
	  to $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE.  getenv() does not work in ISAPI mode,
	  so getenv('HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE') is always NULL with ISAPI.
	  Global variable seems more reliable.

2003-10-10  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/config.inc.php (1.5): + Allow to view weeks in the bottom
	  (trailer.inc) as week numbers (ie. 42) instead of 'first day of
	  the week' (13 Oct). Committing again since John previous commit
	  erased my changes :-)

2003-10-09  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: admin.php (1.12), config.inc.php (1.4), day.php (1.16),
	  del.php (1.10, mrbs-1-2-pre2), edit_area_room.php (1.10,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre2), edit_entry.php (1.20), edit_entry_handler.php
	  (1.13), functions.inc (1.18), help.php (1.11), language.inc
	  (1.1), mincals.inc (1.9, mrbs-1-2-pre2), month.php (1.13),

	  mrbs-1-2-pre2), search.php (1.10, mrbs-1-2-pre2), style.inc
	  (1.8), trailer.inc (1.9, mrbs-1-2-pre2), view_entry.php (1.10),
	  week.php (1.18):
	  * Revamped localisation/internationalisation. MRBS can now be
	  called  fulled Unicode, as long as the config variable
	  $unicode_encoding is	set to 1. If this is set, then MRBS serves
	  all of it's pages in UTF-8  and stores everything in the database
	  in UTF-8. This means that  all languages work together. Other
	  things fixed:

	   - Automatic language determination made much better, works for
	    Windows and Unix servers now, by using different code for each.

	   - There are new configuration variables in config.inc.php now,
	  to
	    configure language/locale settings with much more flexibility.

	    Tested on a Windows+Apache machine, and on a Linux+Apache
	  machine

	    NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:

	    Whenever you want to access the translations you MUST now use:
	      get_vocab('token')
	    instead of
	      $vocab[token]

	    Additionally, if you use a call to date() or strftime() that
	  could
	    return text, as opposed to just numbers, you MUST use
	  utf8_date()
	    and utf8_strftime() instead.

	    Note: Not filled out ChangeLog, because I don't know how (or
	  if)
		  Thierry does it automatically, and I wasn't gonna do it
		  by hand with all the files I changed :)

2003-10-03  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.15), web/config.inc.php (1.3), web/trailer.inc (1.8):

	  Wermelin - SKIOLD Sæby A/S" <ela@skiold.dk>).

	  edit entry page. We now determine the area id  of the room the
	  meeting we're editting is in before  getting a list of the rooms
	  in that area. This solves  a number of errors that occur when
	  editting/creating  bookings. [Note: this is the bug that has been
	  reported  by multiple people on the mailing list.]

	  web/report.php (1.7), web/search.php (1.5), web/style.inc (1.6),
	  web/view_entry.php (1.5):
	     - Changed all uses of <? to <?php.

	     - Merged change from John Beranek for an Advanced search
	  function,
	       requires 3 more translation tokens, which have been added to
	       each language file, "search_button" should be OK, as I took
	       the text from each language's "search" token.

	     - Fixed 2 problems in edit_entry.php as submitted on the
	  mailing list.

	     - Added small enchancement to smb_auth.c, if you pass a
	  username
	       as group/user, it will change the NT group that is used for
	       authentication.

	     - Improved shell escaping in auth_ext.inc. It now uses
	       escapeshellarg() instead of escapeshellcmd(). If your PHP
	       version is less than 4.0.3, then it includes
	  escapeshellarg.inc
	       which is a local implementation of that function.

	     - Added updated Frech translation, as provided by Thierry
	  Wehr.

	     - Tided all language files again, they all have the same
	  format
	       and number of lines now, and are all missing at least 2
	  translations
	       because of the new advanced search functionality.

	     - Fixed a number of bugs to make the Taiwanese translation
	  work.
	       The code to include language files based on
	  HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
	       has been improved, which ensures lang.zh-tw is included.
	       Additionally, mincals.inc not longer does a substr() on the
	       abbreviated weekday names, as this breaks terribly for any
	       multibyte encoding, as it was only taking the first byte
	       of a multibyte encoding. This has the impact that you now
	       get Mon,Tue,Wed etc instead of M,T,W (using glibc's en_GB
	       locale).

	     - print_header() now outputs a DOCTYPE identifier as well as
	       sending Pragma: no-cache and an Expires: header in the
	       past. This should help ensure the calendar pages don't get
	  cached.

	      time for roombooker web pages.  Set config variable
	  $refresh_rate to the
	      number of seconds to refresh after, or set to 0 to disable.

	   * Implemented "n-weekly" repeat type. Not sure I like the way
	  it's phrased in
	      the lang files, but the code works fine.	You can now a
	  meeting that is
	      repeated every 'n' weeks. e.g. every 5th Monday.	This
	  required a database
	      change, which I've made available in upgrade2.my.sql and
	  upgrade2.pg.sql

	   * Tidied lang files, and ensured every file has all the required
	  tokens.
	      'wc -l lang.*' now shows all the files as having the same
	  line count.
	      Quite a few languages now have English bits in them though.

	   * Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that allow you to configure a
	  filter
	      for LDAP authentication.

	   * Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that solve problems with
	  bookings made
	      for times that have smaller granularity that the configured
	  booking
	      resolution.

2001-03-26  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* web/: lang.es (1.6), lang.sv (1.5):
	   * Copied "rep_type_5" language token into Swedish and Spanish
	  language

	  able
	      to use "monthly, corresponding day" repeats without the token
