2007-02-24  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS (tags: mrbs-1_2_5) (mrbs-1_2-branch.6): * Updated NEWS for
	  1.2.5 release (rather late, almost forgot).

2007-02-13  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION, checklang.php (mrbs-1_2-branch.[5,2]) (utags:
	  mrbs-1_2_5):
	  * LDAP auth scheme now has the ability to use LDAP v3 protocol,
	  and to use TLS, if configured to do so in config.inc.php.
	  Implements SF tracker #1644311.

	  * Fixed documentation of auth schemes in AUTHENTICATION to  not
	  mention the getUserPassword() function that is no  longer used.

	  * A few fixes to checklang.php.

	  * Added the ability to configure the cookie path that the  'php'
	  and 'cookie' session schemes use, to override  the
	  auto-determination these schemes use. Also made  the 'cookie'
	  session scheme actually use an expiring  cookie. Fixes SF tracker
	  #1515118.

	  * Removed all use of the utf8_date() function,  utf8_strftime()
	  is used instead. utf8_strftime() now	works around a bug in
	  strftime() in the handling of  %p, using date() if your locale
	  happens to return  empty strings for the %p substitution.

	  * Replaced a short php start tag in edit_entry_handler.php  with
	  the correct long form one. Fixes SF tracker #1652396.   Also
	  corrected a short start tag in lang.es.

	  * Added code into edit_entry_handler.php to support locales  that
	  use ',' as the decimal point. This will translate  "1,5" hours
	  into "1.5" so it is understood. Fixes SF tracker  #1647430.

	  * Added updated Swedish translation tokens, as provided  by
	  bwiberg.

	  * Added AIX support into language.inc. You can now run  MRBS on
	  an AIX server, in Unicode mode too. AIX support  provided (and
	  tested) by bwiberg.

	  * Backported the improved language preference code from  the
	  trunk MRBS development. The preference order of  languages
	  specified by a user is now acted upon.

	  * Corrected some bracketing in month.php, as reported  by a
	  number of people, including 't-matsuu' in SF tracker	#1644042
	  who provided a fix.

	  * Corrected CSS commenting in mrbs.css, as reported  in SF
	  tracker #1644042.

2007-01-24  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS (tags: mrbs-1_2_4) (mrbs-1_2-branch.5): * Updated NEWS and
	  ChangeLogs for MRBS 1.2.4 release.

2006-10-09  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION (tags: mrbs-1_2_4) (mrbs-1_2-branch.4):
	  * Added robots.txt and "Robots" META tag, to stop robots trawling
	   MRBS installations. Fixes SF bug tracker #1557192.

	  * Improved documentation in AUTHENTICATION on LDAP auth method
	  to make it clear that the 'ldap' PHP extension is required.
	  Fixes SF bug tracker #1554351.

	  * Fixes in auth_imap.inc to ensure that internet sockets to  the
	  IMAP server are closed, in an attempt to fix a report  in SF
	  tracker #1558451, though the reporter has since  told me my fixes
	  didn't help his problem...

	  * Fixed example setting of $ldap_filter in config.inc.php,  it
	  showed $ldap_user_filter instead of $ldap_filter.   Fixes SF bug
	  tracker #1550827.

	  * Added a little code to turn $month, $week and $day into
	  integers explicitly, before calling checkdate(), this  was
	  reported under SF tracker #1557192 as a place  where MRBS will
	  output warnings (when being trawled  by GoogleBot).

	  * Added a check in edit_entry_handler.php to ensure  that the
	  "Brief Description" is not empty. This will  only happen if the
	  user doesn't have JavaScript turned  on, as usually there is
	  JavaScript validation that you  enter a description. Translators
	  note that I had to  add two more vocab tokens.

	  * Tidied HTML formatting - just the header section (for now).

	  * Added updated Finnish translation as provided by Tom  Ingberg
	  in SF tracker #1450459. The translation encoding  has changed to
	  UTF-8, so anyone with a Finnish installation	that sets
	  $unicode_encoding to 1 will need to run  convert_db_to_utf8.php
	  to convert the text in  their database from iso-8859-1 to UTF-8.

	  * A few fixes to mysqli.inc that I'd not spotted in my  earlier
	  testing.

	  * A fix in session_php.inc to ensure that the user's password
	  gets unslashed(). Fixed SF bug tracker #1563470.

	  * A few changes in trailer.inc so that the current day/week/month
	   in the trailer links are highlighted somewhat. Implements  SF
	  feature request tracker # 875744.

2006-07-07  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL, README, README.sqlapi (mrbs-1_2-branch.[2,1,1]) (utags:
	  mrbs-1_2_4, mrbs-1_2_5): * Added 'mysqli' database abstraction,
	  to allow PHP 5 installations	to use the newer/better 'mysqli'
	  extension instead of 'mysql'.   Reasonably tested on a Linux
	  Apache 2.2.0/MySQL 5.0.18/PHP 5.1.2	installation. Updated the
	  documentation to mention the new database   abstraction method,
	  hopefully in all the necessary places.

2006-04-26  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION (mrbs-1_2-branch.3): * Upped version number to
	  1.2.3+cvs (rather belatedly)

	  * Fixed some HTML escaping issues in the grids.

	  * Fixed a problem whereby non-repeating entries wouldn't  be
	  emailed to area/room admins. Fixes SF tracker #1474386,  fix
	  provided by 'karcher'.

	  * Added a little error logging into email functionality.   You
	  should get an diagnostic error in your error log if	an email
	  fails to be sent.

	  * Fixed zh-tw translation to correctly specify its encoding as
	  utf-8.

	  * Improved get_vocab() so that it doesn't do an iconv if the
	  language  encoding is utf-8.

	  * Fixed bug in report.php that meant the meeting end date was
	  shown  when the start date should have been. This fix was
	  provided to me  somehow, but I can't find who provided it...

	  * Added "remote_user" session scheme, as provided by 'bwiberg' on
	   SF tracker #1432748. Allows MRBS to be configured to use a
	  server authentication scheme that sets the REMOTE_USER
	  environment  variable.

2005-09-02  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tables.pg.sql (tags: mrbs-1_2_5, mrbs-1_2_4) (mrbs-1_2-branch.2):
	  * Postgresql table creation fixed for Postgresql 8. Integer
	  columns  can't have a DEFAULT of '', fixed this oversight.

2005-09-02  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION, INSTALL, checklang.php (tags: mrbs-1_2_4)
	  (mrbs-1_2-branch.[2,1,1]): * Added ability to change the port of
	  the LDAP server when	the 'ldap' auth scheme is used. Set
	  $ldap_port in config.inc.php	to change from the default port.  *
	  Added documentation for ldap port configuration into
	  AUTHENTICATION, along with some brief details on the 'nis'  auth
	  scheme.  * Tidied up some of the text in INSTALL describing
	  MRBS's i18n  and l10n support.  * Made checklang.php work with
	  register_globals off, and made the  output prettier.	* Fixed a
	  typo in a comment in config.inc.php * Added a missing $ in a
	  Finnish vocab entry.

2005-08-20  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS (tags: mrbs-1_2_3) (mrbs-1_2-branch.4): * Updated ChangeLogs
	  and NEWS for 1.2.3 release.

2005-08-20  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION (tags: mrbs-1_2_3) (mrbs-1_2-branch.1):
	  * Improved db_ext auth scheme - moved the configuration into
	  config.inc.php,  where it belongs. Additionally added support for
	  the password in the  external database being in different
	  formats, namely one of:    - MD5    - SHA1	- crypt    -
	  plaintext   Also documented the scheme in AUTHENTICATION, and
	  added example config	in config.inc.php.

	  * Fixes for cookie and php session schemes, username and password
	  as  obtained from the web form are now 'unslashed' before being
	  stored  and/or passed to the auth scheme.  auth_db.inc updated to
	  escape the  username being putting it in the database query.

	  * Added site_faq_es.html, contributed by Carlos Insunza.

	  features.  ° Updated documentation to add warnings about mrbs not
	  working with postegreSQL version 7.3 and above.

	  Mrbs does not work anymore with postgreSQL dbms since pgsql
	  version 7.3.	This is because the following changes :     - An
	  empty string ('') is no longer allowed as the input into an
	  integer field. Formerly, it was silently interpreted as 0. If you
	  want	     a field to be 0 then explicitly use 0, if you want it
	  to be undefined	then use NULL.	    - "INSERT" statements
	  with column lists must specify all values;	    e.g., INSERT
	  INTO tab (col1, col2) VALUES ('val1') is now invalid.

	  This is a problem since we have to change all sql logic that
	  works fine with mysql just to be compliant with postGreSQL. Since
	  nobody reported this error, I can thinks mrbs users using pgsql
	  are very few.  Currently the new tables.pg.73and_above.sql file
	  allow to create mrbs tables with new postgreSQL versions, but is
	  experimental.  You can still browse existing mrbs tables with new
	  versions, but you cannot add/edit entries/rooms/areas any more.

2003-12-03  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pgsql.before_php42.inc (1.1, mrbs-1_2_5, mrbs-1_2_4, mrbs-1_2_3,
	  mrbs-1_2_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_lastmerge, mrbs-pre-MDB-merge,
	  mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre2): Updated the postgreSql driver (pgsql.inc) to
	  remove deprecated functions. People which still use a php version
	  less than 4.2 will have to replace the existing pgsql.inc file
	  with pgsql.before_php42.inc file and rename it to pgsql.inc

2003-12-01  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHENTICATION (1.19): Complete rewrite of the file in html.
	  Converted to text using detagger
	  (http://www.jafsoft.com/detagger/)

2003-11-18  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	  mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2, mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3,
	  mrbs-1-2-pre2):
	  * Added utility to convert text in the database to UTF8, to  use
	  MRBS with $unicode_encoding set to 1. The administrator  should
	  copy it into the web directory, run it (choosing  the encoding to
	  convert from) ONCE, and then move it back out of  the web
	  directory.

	  * Added comment to my usage of $vocab["charset"] in style.inc, as
	   ist doesn't match the general usage of get_vocab().

2003-11-12  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

2003-10-03  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.15): + Allow to view weeks in the bottom (trailer.inc)

	  Oct) (Per Wermelin - SKIOLD Sæby A/S" <ela@skiold.dk>).

2003-09-25  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

2002-10-08  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smb_auth.c (1.2, mrbs-1_2_5, mrbs-1_2_4, mrbs-1_2_3, mrbs-1_2_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_lastmerge, mrbs-post-MDB-merge,
	  mrbs-pre-MDB-merge, mrbs_MDB-latest, mrbs-1_2_1, mrbs-1_2,
	  mrbs-1_2-branch_bp, mrbs-1-2-pre3, mrbs-1-2-pre2, mrbs-1-2-pre1,
	  Root-of-mrbs_MDB, mrbs-1-1):
	     - Changed all uses of <? to <?php.

	     - Merged change from John Beranek for an Advanced search
	  function,
	       requires 3 more translation tokens, which have been added to
	       each language file, "search_button" should be OK, as I took
	       the text from each language's "search" token.

	     - Fixed 2 problems in edit_entry.php as submitted on the
	  mailing list.

	     - Added small enchancement to smb_auth.c, if you pass a
	  username
	       as group/user, it will change the NT group that is used for
	       authentication.

	     - Improved shell escaping in auth_ext.inc. It now uses
	       escapeshellarg() instead of escapeshellcmd(). If your PHP
	       version is less than 4.0.3, then it includes
	  escapeshellarg.inc
	       which is a local implementation of that function.

	     - Added updated Frech translation, as provided by Thierry
	  Wehr.

	     - Tided all language files again, they all have the same
	  format
	       and number of lines now, and are all missing at least 2
	  translations
	       because of the new advanced search functionality.

	     - Fixed a number of bugs to make the Taiwanese translation
	  work.
	       The code to include language files based on
	  HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
	       has been improved, which ensures lang.zh-tw is included.
	       Additionally, mincals.inc not longer does a substr() on the
	       abbreviated weekday names, as this breaks terribly for any
	       multibyte encoding, as it was only taking the first byte
	       of a multibyte encoding. This has the impact that you now
	       get Mon,Tue,Wed etc instead of M,T,W (using glibc's en_GB
	       locale).

	     - print_header() now outputs a DOCTYPE identifier as well as
	       sending Pragma: no-cache and an Expires: header in the
	       past. This should help ensure the calendar pages don't get
	  cached.

2002-05-11  Daniel <nambit@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.12), README (1.8) (utags: mrbs-1-1): stop saying that

	  Root-of-mrbs_MDB, mrbs-1-1): change last $lang to $vocab

2002-05-09  Daniel <nambit@users.sourceforge.net>

	* LANGUAGE (1.9, Root-of-mrbs_MDB, mrbs-1-1), checklang.php (1.3):
	     Change every $lang to $vocab to stop conflicts with other
	  software
	      that's used $lang (lots of people have seen "N" appear
	  everywhere
	      $lang variables should be)

2002-05-08  Daniel <nambit@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL (1.11): document need for register_globals

2002-02-07  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* UPGRADE (1.5), tables.pg.sql (1.4, mrbs-1-2-pre2),
	  upgrade2.pg.sql (1.2, mrbs-1-2-pre2) (utags: Root-of-mrbs_MDB,
	  mrbs-1-1, mrbs-1-2-pre1): * Added instructions into UPGRADE
	  readme for upgrade2.[my|pg].ql scripts  that are required to
	  upgrade from an older MRBS installation.

	  * Added new language tokens, using patch supplied by Michael
	  Redinger.

	  * Added new or updated translations for:     Italy (Gianni)
	  Netherlands  (Marc ter Horst)     Norway (Rune Johansen)
	  Sweden (Hakan Nilsson)     German (Michael Redinger)

	  * Added auth_imap.inc, an authentication scheme that uses IMAP,
	  this includes a few more (commented out) lines in config.inc

	  * Changed datatype of 'rep_num_weeks' in 'mrbs_repeat' table for
	  PostgreSQL installs.	We now use smallint instead of tinyint,  as
	  tinyint isn't available.

	  * Changed config.inc to use getenv('HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE')
	  instead  of $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE...much tidier.

2001-07-16  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* upgrade2.my.sql (1.1, mrbs-1-2-pre2, mrbs-1-2-pre1,

	  mrbs-1-0-final):
	   * Added these upgrade SQL files.  Don't know how I forgot to add
	  them!

2001-07-02  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tables.my.sql (1.3, mrbs-1-2-pre2, mrbs-1-2-pre1,
	  Root-of-mrbs_MDB, mrbs-1-1), tables.pg.sql (1.3) (utags:
	  mrbs-1-0-final):  * Incorporated diff from Scott Leonard that
	  allows you to configure a refresh
	      time for roombooker web pages.  Set config variable
	  $refresh_rate to the
	      number of seconds to refresh after, or set to 0 to disable.

	   * Implemented "n-weekly" repeat type. Not sure I like the way
	  it's phrased in
	      the lang files, but the code works fine.	You can now a
	  meeting that is
	      repeated every 'n' weeks. e.g. every 5th Monday.	This
	  required a database
	      change, which I've made available in upgrade2.my.sql and
	  upgrade2.pg.sql

	   * Tidied lang files, and ensured every file has all the required
	  tokens.
	      'wc -l lang.*' now shows all the files as having the same
	  line count.
	      Quite a few languages now have English bits in them though.

	   * Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that allow you to configure a
	  filter
	      for LDAP authentication.

	   * Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that solve problems with
	  bookings made
	      for times that have smaller granularity that the configured
	  booking
	      resolution.

	* INSTALL (1.3, mrbs0-6):    Fixed bug in edit_entry_handler.php3

		   midnight would not show up
