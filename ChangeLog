2008-12-03 14:27  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r965] web/version.inc:
	  
	  * Updated version number to 1.4.

2008-12-03 14:27  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r964] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  * Tweaked the comment in config.inc.php about setting $timezone.

2008-11-14 15:31  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r963] web/lang.en:
	  
	  * Third time lucky with translation update!

2008-11-14 15:29  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r962] web/lang.en:
	  
	  * Fixed a typo in my previous translation update.

2008-11-14 15:25  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r961] web/lang.en:
	  
	  * Clarified 'no_users_create_first_admin' English translation a
	  bit.

2008-11-14 14:20  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r960] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Added a comment to the config file to make it clear that the 'db'
	  authentication scheme relies on there being an admin user called
	  'administrator' for initial set-up.

2008-11-14 13:07  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r959] web/edit_users.php:
	  
	  Changed the value of the Submit button when adding or editing a
	  user from "OK" to "Save". The "OK" button was misleading as it
	  could be interpreted as a request to acknowledge an error
	  message.

2008-11-14 12:49  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r958] web/edit_users.php, web/lang.en:
	  
	  Changed edit_users.php so that it won't accept users with no
	  name.

2008-11-14 12:29  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r957] web/edit_users.php:
	  
	  Fixed bug in edit_users.php, so that field values (eg user names)
	  are now put through htmlspecialchars() before being displayed in
	  the user list.

2008-11-14 12:16  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r956] web/edit_users.php, web/lang.en:
	  
	  Fixed SF bug 2275465, originally reported by Simon Hunter.
	  Edit_users will now ensure that user names are unique.

2008-11-09 22:04  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r955] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  * Commented out default timezone in config.inc.php, I didn't mean
	  to have it uncommented.

2008-11-09 21:59  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r954] web/add.php, web/auth_db.inc, web/config.inc.php,
	  web/edit_area_room.php, web/edit_users.php, web/functions.inc,
	  web/mrbs_sql.inc, web/session_http.inc, web/site_faq_nl.html:
	  
	  * Fixed database escaping issues, reported as SF tracker #2229897
	  and diagnosed by 'mahbr'.
	  
	  * Added setting into config.inc.php (and code to use it) to set
	  the timezone that the MRBS web server runs in. This is especially
	  required with PHP 5 on Linux, as if you don't set the timezone it
	  seems PHP just runs without any proper timezone functionality.

2008-11-07 14:35  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r953] web/edit_entry_handler.php:
	  
	  * Fixed booking of meetings when $twentyfourhour_format is 0.
	  Wasn't reading the 'ampm' form field in edit_entry_handler.php.
	  Reported in SF tracker #2107847 by jwarchol.

2008-11-05 17:41  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r952] web/xbLib.js:
	  
	  Modified xblSetNodeBgColor(node, color) so that it can cope with
	  a null color. Although most browsers seem to accept a value of
	  null being passed to setAttribute or setProperty, some, eg
	  Konqueror, do not. It was this that was causing the "sticky
	  highlighting" problem in Konqueror. (Although the "sticky
	  highlighting" problem has already been cured by ensuring that a
	  null value is never passed to xblSetNodeBgColor(), this change is
	  being made as an added precaution).

2008-10-28 01:37  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r951] web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Tweaked formatting of edit_entry form

2008-10-28 01:23  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r950] web/edit_entry.php, web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  (1) Fixed layout of am/pm radio buttons in the edit_entry form
	  (when not using 24 hour format) (2) Tweaked styling of inputs on
	  the edit_entry form

2008-10-26 18:35  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r949] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  * Patch to fix a problem reported in SF tracker #2193184. Problem
	  reported and patch supplied by 'peterjclaw'.

2008-10-21 21:57  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r948] web/mrbs-ielte6.css, web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Implemented $month_cell_scrolling so that the scrolling behaviour
	  in the month view can be easily turned off and on.

2008-10-19 11:45  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r947] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Fixed the comments concerning the use of a company logo: made the
	  suggested code HTMl 4.01 compliant.

2008-10-19 08:04  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r946] web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  (1) Fixed problem whereby the minical links were not behaving
	  properly when you hovered over them (because I'd forgotten to
	  restrict the tr:hover behaviour to the bookings table when
	  introducing CSS highlighting) (2) Tweaked the default colour for
	  an invalid day in the month view to tie in to the default colour
	  scheme (3) Tweaked the default colour for the search term in
	  search results to tie in to the default colour scheme

2008-10-18 21:49  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r945] ChangeLog:
	  
	  * Unset 'svn:keywords' on ChangeLog.

2008-10-18 19:41  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r943] ChangeLog, NEWS:
	  
	  * Updated NEWS and ChangeLog for MRBS 1.4beta2 release.

2008-10-18 18:59  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r942] web/version.inc:
	  
	  * Updated version specifier to 1.4beta2.

2008-10-18 09:16  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r941] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  Optimised HTML output in tdcell by suppressing rowspan="n" when
	  n=1.

2008-10-17 15:04  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r940] web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Updated comments to explain the new behaviour whereby the time
	  period cell corresponding to the start of a booking is
	  highlighted when you hover over a booked cell.

2008-10-17 12:20  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r939] web/language.inc:
	  
	  * Added Hungarian support to the internationalisation - only
	  required entries in the Windows specific maps, as hu_HU is the
	  POSIX locale.

2008-10-17 11:18  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r938] web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Tweaked default colours to provide more contrast between odd and
	  even rows.

2008-10-16 21:29  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r937] LANGUAGE, web/functions_mail.inc, web/lang.ca,
	  web/lang.es:
	  
	  * Removed all HTML entities in the translations apart from
	  &nbsp;. The only two languages that used these were Spanish and
	  Catalan. Updated LANGUAGE document to tell translators to not use
	  character entities. This was all done because functions_mail.inc
	  was having to call html_entity_decode() to remove the HTML
	  entities, but this function was only added in PHP 4.3, and only
	  works properly (in UTF-8) from PHP 5. The use of
	  html_entity_decode() has now been removed.

2008-10-16 09:43  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r936] web/config.inc.php, web/month.php, web/mrbs.css.php,
	  web/style.inc, web/week.php, web/xbLib.js:
	  
	  Fixed the problem of poor performance of cell highlighting in IE7
	  and IE8 when the day and week tables are large by implementing
	  CSS highlighting (ie using the :hover pseudo-class) as the
	  default. JavaScript highlighting is now only used if (a)
	  $javascript_cursor is set to true in the config file and (b) the
	  browser is IE6 or less. At the same time changed the default mode
	  for JavaScript highlighting back to 'hybrid', as this gives
	  better performance than 'class' for IE6.

2008-10-14 10:23  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r935] web/lang.ja:
	  
	  * Updated Japanese translation from MATSUURA Takanori.

2008-10-09 15:40  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r934] web/xbLib.js:
	  
	  Reverted last set of changes

2008-10-09 14:26  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r933] web/xbLib.js:
	  
	  Implemented a better fix for the Konqueror "sticky highlighting"
	  problem - as suggested by Jean-François Larvoire

2008-10-01 12:47  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r932] web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Added some padding to the table header cells in the
	  day/week/month views.

2008-09-30 12:21  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r931] web/config.inc.php, web/xbLib.js:
	  
	  Fixed the "sticky highlighting" problem in Konqueror (highlighted
	  cells do not go back to normal when you move the mouse out and
	  the highlight method is set to "hybrid").

2008-09-28 19:16  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r930] web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Changed default colours for booking types.

2008-09-28 18:56  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r929] web/day.php, web/month.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  Fixed bug introduced in revision 890. Day/week/month now use the
	  database abstraction layer.

2008-09-26 10:16  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r928] web/del_entry.php:
	  
	  Ensured that if you delete an entry you go back to the view you
	  started from, rather than the day view. (See also Revision 921).

2008-09-26 10:06  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r927] web/view_entry.php:
	  
	  Fixed view_entry.php so that if you edit or copy an entry from
	  here, then you go back afterwards to where you were beforehand
	  (with some sensible view if you got there from an email). (See
	  also Revision 921)

2008-09-26 08:25  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r926] web/edit_entry.php, web/session_cookie.inc,
	  web/session_php.inc:
	  
	  Fixed the edit entry procedure so that if you try to create a new
	  booking without first being logged on, you are returned at the
	  end of the procedure to the view that you started at, instead of
	  being returned to the default view. (See also Revision 921).

2008-09-25 22:47  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r925] web/add.php, web/admin.php, web/del.php,
	  web/del_entry.php, web/edit_area_room.php, web/edit_entry.php,
	  web/edit_entry_handler.php, web/edit_users.php,
	  web/mrbs_auth.inc:
	  
	  Tidied up changes for "sticky room" by ensuring that the room
	  information is passed to showAccessDenied.

2008-09-25 21:32  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r924] web/edit_entry_handler.php:
	  
	  Modified edit_entry_handler.php so that the "sticky day" and
	  "sticky room" are updated when a booking is made, as presumably
	  the user is now interested in the day and room that they were
	  trying to book, rather than the previous sticky day and room.

2008-09-25 20:03  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r923] web/edit_entry_handler.php:
	  
	  Modified edit_entry_handler.php so that the possibility of the
	  return url giving an endless loop is avoided.

2008-09-25 18:59  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r922] web/admin.php, web/day.php, web/del.php,
	  web/edit_area_room.php, web/edit_entry.php,
	  web/edit_entry_handler.php, web/edit_users.php,
	  web/functions.inc, web/help.php, web/month.php,
	  web/mrbs_auth.inc, web/report.php, web/search.php,
	  web/session_cookie.inc, web/session_php.inc, web/view_entry.php,
	  web/week.php:
	  
	  Ensured that room information is preserved as you switch between
	  views (ie in the same that the day information is now preserved
	  as the "sticky day", so there is a "sticky room").

2008-09-23 08:20  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r921] web/edit_entry_handler.php:
	  
	  Fixed edit_entry_handler.php so that on exit it returns to the
	  page it was called from instead of going automatically to the day
	  view.

2008-09-23 08:18  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r920] web/month.php:
	  
	  Added day information to the room and area HTML links in the
	  month view (the Select drop-down menus were OK, as were the day
	  and week views).

2008-09-19 09:28  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r919] web/month.php, web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  1. Improved behaviour of new booking link in the month view so
	  that the link is now active everywhere in the cell where there
	  isn't something else.
	  
	  2. Changed the title for bookings in the month view so that the
	  full information (slot time and description) is displayed in the
	  title tooltip when you hover over the booking for all three modes
	  ('slot', 'description' and 'both').

2008-09-18 15:41  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r918] web/mincals.inc, web/mrbs.css.php, web/trailer.inc,
	  web/week.php:
	  
	  (1) Added highlighting of the "sticky day" to the mini-cals, on
	  top of highlighting the current day/week/month.
	  
	  (2) Implemented the "sticky day" in the week links, preserving
	  the day of the week when moving to a week for which the current
	  sticky day is invalid.
	  
	  (3) Added links to the View Day/Week/Month labels in the classic
	  trailer, to bring it into line with the simple trailer and to
	  assist navigation between the day/week/month views now that the
	  "sticky date" concept is working.

2008-09-18 08:46  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r917] web/lang.it:
	  
	  * A few Italian translation updates, from Erica Maria Peressini.

2008-09-17 15:54  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r916] web/month.php, web/trailer.inc:
	  
	  Improved links in trailer and month views so that day information
	  is preserved if possible (following Chris Cook's suggestion).

2008-09-17 15:09  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r915] web/day.php, web/month.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  Improved choice of default day in month.php following Chris
	  Cook's suggestion. At the same time tidied up default date
	  selection in day and week views.

2008-09-17 14:21  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r914] web/lang.ca, web/lang.es, web/lang.eu, web/lang.sv,
	  web/lang.zh-cn, web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  1. Fixed internationalisation issues in CSS (the CSS was
	  generating commas as decimal points in some locales).
	  
	  2. Adjusted default CSS sizes to suit most translations.
	  
	  3. Tidied up some language files - removing superfluous colons or
	  correcting typos in HTML entities.

2008-09-17 09:41  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r913] web/config.inc.php, web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  1. Fixed problem that caused the admin form in Safari to stretch
	  to the full screen width
	  
	  2. Changed default setting of show_plus_link to be 'false'.
	  
	  3. Changed default setting of highlight_method to be 'class'.
	  This lets you specify other properties for highlighted cells
	  apart from just the background colour - in particular the font
	  colour so that if you switch to a light background you can switch
	  the font to be dark. (It also avoids the "sticky highlighting"
	  problem in Konqueror which shows up using 'hybrid'. This problem
	  still needs to be fixed though). Also adjusted some of the
	  styling to work better with 'class'.

2008-09-16 15:53  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r912] web/mrbs-ielte6.css, web/mrbs.css.php, web/search.php,
	  web/trailer.inc:
	  
	  1. Improved display (kept left-right alignment of labels and
	  inputs) when the browser window width is decreased for the
	  edit_entry, search, report and logon forms.
	  
	  2. Improved display of trailer, especially when the browser width
	  is decreased.

2008-09-16 12:57  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r911] web/edit_entry.php, web/edit_entry_handler.php:
	  
	  * Added missing 'period' form variable in edit_entry.php and
	  edit_entry_handler.php that was stopping correct booking of
	  meetings if you were in 'periods' mode. As reported and solved by
	  Chris Cook on the mailing list.

2008-09-16 09:37  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r910] web/config.inc.php, web/report.php:
	  
	  * Fixed problem that caused selection of booking type in reports
	  not to work.
	  
	  * Fixed small typo in the config file.

2008-09-16 09:32  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r909] web/edit_entry.php:
	  
	  Fixed bug that caused selection of multiple rooms not to work

2008-09-15 15:43  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r908] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  Fixed bug that caused incorrect number of days to be displayed in
	  date selector when first loaded (and also caused Internet
	  Explorer to report "Done, but with errors on page" in status bar)

2008-09-15 10:35  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r907] web/lang.fr:
	  
	  * French translation updates from Alain PORTAL.

2008-09-14 19:03  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r906] web/lang.cz[DEL], web/lang.es, web/lang.it, web/lang.tr:
	  
	  * Updated Italian translations from Erica Maria Peressini,
	  Turkish translations from Ahmet YILDIZ and Spanish translations
	  from SoTMaR.
	  
	  * Deleted old, incorrectly named lang.cz translation, the proper
	  file is lang.cs.

2008-09-13 22:02  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r905] web/site_faq_nl.html:
	  
	  * Converted some encoded characters to character entities, as
	  encoded characters are unsafe in FAQ files in MRBS's current
	  internationalisation implementation.

2008-09-13 21:24  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r904] web/site_faq_nl.html:
	  
	  * Added Dutch site FAQ, as provided by Cor Marjee.

2008-09-13 21:19  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r903] web/lang.nl:
	  
	  * Dutch translation updates from Cor Marjee.

2008-09-13 21:03  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r902] web/lang.sl:
	  
	  * Slovenian translation updates from Martin Terbuc.

2008-09-13 19:48  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r901] web/functions.inc, web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Moved the styling introduced in Revision 895 out of functions.inc
	  and into CSS

2008-09-13 19:13  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r900] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  The bug fix in Revision 895 was incomplete. The colour key table
	  should now be fixed so that incomplete first rows are drawn
	  properly, as well as incomplete subsequent rows.

2008-09-13 17:52  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r899] web/trailer.inc:
	  
	  Fixed links in "simple trailer" so that the area and room are
	  correct

2008-09-13 17:46  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r898] web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Improved display of trailer in "classic" view

2008-09-13 17:07  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r897] web/month.php:
	  
	  Added a title to the booking in "both" mode, so that the full
	  text of the booking description can be seen when you hover over
	  it.

2008-09-13 16:54  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r896] web/config.inc.php, web/mrbs.css.php, web/trailer.inc:
	  
	  Implemented the "simple trailer" as suggested by Chris Cook

2008-09-13 15:30  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r895] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  Improved display of colour key tables so that cell borders are
	  not drawn at the end of an incomplete row.

2008-09-13 15:04  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r894] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  Fixed bug that caused colour key table to be drawn incorrectly
	  when there were more than 10 colour types

2008-09-13 14:59  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r893] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  Improved layout of colour key table so that unequal rows are
	  avoided if possible.

2008-09-10 22:30  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r892] web/month.php:
	  
	  Fixed bug which caused HTML validation to fail in the month view
	  if the first day of the month was also the first day of the week
	  (ie no greyed out days at the beginning of the first row).

2008-09-10 21:45  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r891] web/day.php, web/month.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  Fixed a typo in the comments in the last change

2008-09-10 21:32  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r890] web/day.php, web/month.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  Improved the display of the day/week/month views so that the area
	  select box or list is not displayed if there is only one area
	  defined (as then it's redundant).

2008-09-10 20:07  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r889] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  Improved the layout of the colour key table when there are long
	  type descriptions (which one would not normally expect anyway).
	  The content is now clipped so that the table does not become too
	  large, but in order that you can still read the full description
	  if you want to, it's also in the title for the cell: so hovering
	  over the cell will give you the full description.

2008-09-10 16:04  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r888] web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Fixed bug whereby the CSS for an all day booking wasn't being
	  generated. It seems that the only visible effect was that an all
	  day booking cell was only clickable over the text, rather than
	  the whole cell. However there may have been other problems that I
	  hadn't noticed.

2008-09-10 15:45  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r887] web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Fixed minor problem whereby, with $show_plus_link set to FALSE,
	  the cursor wasn't showing a pointer when hovering over an empty
	  cell, even though the link was active.

2008-09-09 20:21  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r886] NEWS:
	  
	  * Fixed a few typos/spelling mistakes in NEWS.

2008-09-09 19:51  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r883] ChangeLog:
	  
	  * Updated changelog for MRBS 1.4beta1 release.

2008-09-09 19:48  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r882] NEWS, web/version.inc:
	  
	  * Changed beta version specifier to 1.4beta1.
	  
	  * Updated NEWS for 1.4beta1 release.

2008-09-09 16:36  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	  * Updated version number for MRBS 1.4-b1.

2008-09-09 16:31  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r877] web/config.inc.php, web/help.php, web/lang.en,
	  web/mrbs-print.css:
	  
	  * Added missing emacs mode specifier to the top of lang.en
	  
	  * Added back "server time" display to help page that was lost in
	  the branch merge.
	  
	  * Added back definition of $default_duration in config.inc.php,
	  that was lost in the branch merge.
	  
	  * The 'plus' graphic is now hidden when printing.
	  
	  * Set svn:keywords for mrbs-print.css in order to get $Id$ filled
	  out.

	  web/xbLib.js:

2008-09-04 10:23  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r875] web/edit_entry_handler.php:
	  
	  Fixed bug introduced when previously fixing the "all day" bug

2008-09-03 22:47  Campbell Morrison <cimorrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r874] web/month.php, web/mrbs-ie.css, web/mrbs-ielte6.css,
	  web/mrbs.css.php:
	  
	  Added colour coding to main table in month view, together with
	  better handling of overflow.

	  files, so that xemacs will know what encoding the files are in.

2008-08-29 19:31  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	  web/lang.zh-cn, web/lang.zh-tw:
	  
	  * Emails sent from MRBS now encode the subject data correctly, if
	  the subject contains anything but ASCII.
	  
	  * Moved the email translation tokens back into the lang.* files,
	  where they belong, instead of having them in config.inc.php. Note
	  to translators: this means that only there is only English text
	  for $vocab["mail_*"] apart from the partial translations in the
	  Japanese and Turkish files.

2008-08-19 20:01  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r859] web/language.inc:
	  
	  * Patch from SF tracker #2057646 - fixes the arguments of
	  utf8_convert_aix(). Patch provided by bwiberg.

2008-08-18 11:55  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r858] web/session_cookie.inc:
	  
	  * Added missing calls to unslashes() in session_cookie.inc. I
	  believe they're not strictly necessary, but it's best to be safe.

2008-08-18 11:38  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r857] web/Blowfish, web/Blowfish.php,
	  web/Blowfish/DefaultKey.php, web/config.inc.php,
	  web/session_cookie.inc:
	  
	  * Revamped 'cookie' session scheme, so that the client receives
	  and stores an encrypted session token. MRBS then validates this
	  token on each page fetch. Adds new configuration items into
	  config.inc.php.
	  
	  * Added Crypt_Blowfish PEAR module, version 1.0.1 - used by
	  session_cookie.inc.

2008-08-07 19:16  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r855] web/lang.de:
	  
	  * A few translation updates from the mailing list, with a few
	  corrections.

2008-07-18 21:31  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r844] ChangeLog:
	  
	  * Authors in the ChangeLog now have proper names/email addresses,
	  svn2cl is now called with the --authors option.

2008-07-18 21:21  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r842] ChangeLog, testdata.php, web/admin.php,

	  web/lang.tr, web/lang.zh-cn, web/lang.zh-tw, web/mysqli.inc:
	  
	  * Updated a few tokens in the German translation, curtesy of my
	  wife.
	  
	  * Added "server time" to help page, necessitating a new
	  translation token, "servertime". The only other language this is
	  translated for is German.
	  
	  * Improved the display of the "Browser language section" in the
	  admin page, and added it to the help page too. This changed the
	  meaning of the "browserlang" translation token a bit, and removed
	  the need for the "postbrowserlang" token.
	  
	  * Fixed a bug in the mysqli database abstraction, along the way
	  made get_default_area() in functions.inc more robust.
	  
	  * Added $default_duration into config.inc.php, which allows the
	  administrator to change the default booking duration, which was
	  previously hard-coded into edit_entry.php.
	  
	  * Corrected incorrect short PHP tag in testdata.php.
	  
	  * New svn2cl generated ChangeLog.

2008-04-17 20:29  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	  * Improved and standardised coding style/standard throughout. Now
	  don't use # comments anywhere, only // and /* */. Removed all
	  tabs, replaced with 2 spaces. Ensured every block use braces.

2008-04-14 20:37  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r801] web/day.php, web/functions.inc, web/month.php,
	  web/mrbs-print.css, web/report.php, web/style.inc,
	  web/trailer.inc, web/week.php:
	  
	  * Replaced old dodgy "print preview" functionality with proper
	  CSS 'print' media method. Page elements not appropriate for
	  printing are now removed automatically by the user's browser when
	  the user prints.

2008-04-13 20:50  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r800] web/add.php, web/admin.php, web/day.php, web/del.php,

	  web/trailer.inc, web/version.inc, web/view_entry.php,
	  web/week.php:
	  
	  * Improved HTML and SQL escaping throughout (mostly HTML).
	  
	  * Improved HTML throughout, indented things nicely in some files
	  but not others. Moved to all lower case tags/attribs and quoted
	  attrib values (ready for XHTML?).
	  
	  * Removed the _horrible_ (and probably insecure) unpacking of
	  $_GET and $_POST. Each file now specifically gets form variables,
	  and converts them to the right type. Implemented new function,
	  get_form_val() in grab_globals.inc to facilitate this.
	  
	  * Removed the use of numerically indexed SQL row fetches. Almost
	  every SQL query now uses sql_row_keyed() to get a named
	  associative array, which makes the code far more readable, and in
	  some cases far easier.
	  
	  * Belatedly updated the version number, realised I didn't even
	  update it for the 1.2.6.1 release.

2008-04-13 20:02  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r799] auth_ldap.pl:

	  Subversion showing diffs.

2008-04-12 21:05  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r796] .[CPY]:
	  
	  * Moved mrbs-1_2-branch onto trunk, in order to promote it to the
	  active development line. Previously moved the trunk off to
	  branches/abandoned-mrbs-1_3-development/ to abandon the trunk
	  development that was working towards MRBS 1.3.

2008-04-12 20:03  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r794]
	  
	  * Set some MIME types.
	  
	  * Removed incorrect 'executable' property on some files.
	  
	  * Corrected a few places that over-zealously HTML escaped &
	  characters. Namely when the URL in question is only used in a
	  Location: redirect, where HTML escaping is unnecessary and
	  incorrect.

2008-04-03 18:59  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r792]
	  
	  * Merged mrbs12_better_html branch, which gives MRBS correct HTML
	  4.01 Transitional HTML. Majority of changes thanks to Claudio
	  Strizzolo.

2008-03-21 21:24  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r788]
	  
	  * Upped width of mrbs_entry.create_by to 80 characters, to match
	  the other schemas.

2008-03-21 20:14  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r787]
	  
	  * Added Basque translation, curtesy of Juan Ezeiza GutiÃ©rrez.

	* [r786]
	  
	  * Updated Japanese translation from MATSUURA Takanori in SF
	  #1806694. I had to correct the translation tokens for the places
	  where I moved final colons into the code. I've hopefully changed
	  only the required ones.

2008-03-19 21:06  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r785]
	  
	  * Made mysql.inc use the explicit database connection that is
	  opened. Based on a patch posted on Sourceforge by an anonymous
	  user.
	  
	  * Added Simplified Chinese translation, provided by 'sunjunps' on
	  SF tracker #1818278.

2008-01-30 10:53  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r781]

	  * Updated NEWS for 1.2.6.1 release.

2008-01-30 10:43  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r779]
	  
	  * Fixed major bug in LDAP authentication is $ldap_search_attrib
	  was set. It was incorrectly letting any username/password
	  combination in!
	  
	  * Added description of new LDAP auth configuration variables into
	  config.inc.php, and changed the default of $ldap_v3 to "true".

2008-01-28 15:52  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r773]
	  
	  * Updated ChangeLog for 1.2.6 release.

2008-01-28 15:50  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r772]
	  
	  * Added copy booking/series feature, as provided by Julian
	  Eglestaff. Adds two new translation tokens, which are now only
	  available in English.

2008-01-28 15:06  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r771]
	  
	  * Updated ChangeLog for release of 1.2.6.

2008-01-28 15:04  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r770]
	  
	  * Updated NEWS for release of 1.2.6.

2008-01-28 14:43  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r769]
	  
	  * Removed a few terminating colons in the French translation that
	  slipped through. Gives me a chance to acknowledge dionysos-sf for
	  providing the updated French translation (in SF #1791821).

2008-01-28 14:37  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r768]
	  
	  * Removed all terminating colons from the translations, moving
	  them to the (arguably) correct place: the code.
	  
	  * Added JavaScript and server side checking for setting of a
	  repeat day if a booking requires one.
	  
	  * Added server side checking for setting a valid n-weekly value.
	  
	  * Emails sent by MRBS are now in UTF-8 (if $unicode_encoding is
	  1), unless $mail_vocab is set to something else.
	  
	  * Added Turkish support and translation, thanks to Ahmet YILDIZ.
	  
	  * Removed possible infinite loop in n-weekly booking creation.
	  
	  * Fixed invalid truncation of text in month.php, it could
	  truncate descriptions mid-UTF8 sequence before.
	  
	  * Added new auth method, imap_php, which authenticates via IMAP,
	  but using the PHP 'imap' extension, which allows for SSL/TLS
	  connections.
	  
	  * Upped version number to 1.2.6 in preparation for a release.

2008-01-28 11:28  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r767]
	  
	  * auth_ldap: Added support for searching the LDAP directory for
	  the full DN to try and bind with. This allows for operation with
	  Microsoft AD servers. Utilises new config variable
	  $ldap_dn_search_attrib, and optionally $ldap_dn_search_dn (the DN
	  to bind with for the search) and $ldap_dn_search_password (the
	  password to bind with). If $ldap_dn_search_dn is set,
	  $ldap_dn_search_password MUST be set. NOTE: This is as yet
	  untested, as I don't currently have an MRBS test installation
	  that can bind to an AD server for testing.

2008-01-28 11:20  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r766]
	  
	  * Detabbified (4 space indent now) auth_ldap.inc, so it's easier
	  to edit. Only whitespace changes.,

2007-09-07 12:50  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r765]
	  
	  * Fix for SF tracker #1666299, as supplied by the reporter,
	  'northtommy'. Update of the room list as you change area in the
	  edit entry screen is now correct.

2007-06-18 13:40  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r764]
	  
	  * Fixed HTML escaping problem in edit_entry.php, the ENT_NOQUOTES
	  mode of htmlspecialchars() was being used, when it shouldn't have
	  been.

2007-06-18 09:25  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r763]
	  
	  * A few fixes in checklang.php to make it work better and be more
	  useful.
	  
	  * Removed unnecessary table HTML tags in edit_area_room.php.
	  Fixes SF tracker #1696383, as reported by 'mikedip'.
	  
	  * Fixed SQL escaping in edit_users.php, also required changes to
	  pgsql.inc and mysqli.inc to fix the sql_field_type() function.
	  
	  * i18n/l10n fixes in language.inc. Windows locale map
	  extended/fixed, added Catalan support, improved the map the Unix
	  locale map was applied. Catalan translation provided by Jordi
	  Prats.
	  
	  * Fixed bug in language preference code, fix supplied by
	  'mikedip' in SF tracker #1696382.

2007-03-01 14:36  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r762]
	  
	  * Added updated Italian translation and Italian FAQ, as posted on
	  mrbs-general more than 2 years ago!

2007-02-25 18:41  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r761]
	  
	  * Added support for Slovenian language, and added translation
	  provided by Martin Terbuc.

2007-02-24 20:34  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r753]
	  
	  * Added a new-style, unified ChangeLog.

2007-02-24 20:32  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r752]
	  
	  * Removed sub-directory ChangeLog, I've decided it makes no
	  sense.
	  
	  * Upped version number to "1.2.5+cvs".

2007-02-24 20:14  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r750]
	  
	  * Updated ChangeLogs for 1.2.5 release (again!).

2007-02-24 20:12  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r749]
	  
	  * Updated NEWS for 1.2.5 release (rather late, almost forgot).

2007-02-23 22:12  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r745]
	  
	  * Updated ChangeLogs for 1.2.5 release.

2007-02-23 22:06  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r744]
	  
	  * Fixed a few bugs in month view, including double escaping of
	  the < and > characters used in booking slot descriptions (SF
	  tracker #1663905) and also the times were being shown
	  incorrectly, as date() was being used instead of the now standard
	  (for anything displayed to the user) utf8_strftime().
	  
	  * Upped version to 1.2.5 in preparation for release.

2007-02-13 13:05  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r743]
	  
	  * Got rid of nasty DOS line endings in lang.sv.

2007-02-13 12:53  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r742]
	  
	  * LDAP auth scheme now has the ability to use LDAP v3 protocol,
	  and to use TLS, if configured to do so in config.inc.php.
	  Implements SF tracker #1644311.
	  
	  * Fixed documentation of auth schemes in AUTHENTICATION to not
	  mention the getUserPassword() function that is no longer used.
	  
	  * A few fixes to checklang.php.
	  
	  * Added the ability to configure the cookie path that the 'php'
	  and 'cookie' session schemes use, to override the
	  auto-determination these schemes use. Also made the 'cookie'
	  session scheme actually use an expiring cookie. Fixes SF tracker
	  #1515118.
	  
	  * Removed all use of the utf8_date() function, utf8_strftime() is
	  used instead. utf8_strftime() now works around a bug in
	  strftime() in the handling of %p, using date() if your locale
	  happens to return empty strings for the %p substitution.
	  
	  * Replaced a short php start tag in edit_entry_handler.php with
	  the correct long form one. Fixes SF tracker #1652396. Also
	  corrected a short start tag in lang.es.
	  
	  * Added code into edit_entry_handler.php to support locales that
	  use ',' as the decimal point. This will translate "1,5" hours
	  into "1.5" so it is understood. Fixes SF tracker #1647430.
	  
	  * Added updated Swedish translation tokens, as provided by
	  bwiberg.
	  
	  * Added AIX support into language.inc. You can now run MRBS on an
	  AIX server, in Unicode mode too. AIX support provided (and
	  tested) by bwiberg.
	  
	  * Backported the improved language preference code from the trunk
	  MRBS development. The preference order of languages specified by
	  a user is now acted upon.
	  
	  * Corrected some bracketing in month.php, as reported by a number
	  of people, including 't-matsuu' in SF tracker #1644042 who
	  provided a fix.
	  
	  * Corrected CSS commenting in mrbs.css, as reported in SF tracker
	  #1644042.

2007-01-24 11:12  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r739]
	  
	  * Updated NEWS and ChangeLogs for MRBS 1.2.4 release.

2007-01-24 10:40  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r738]
	  
	  * Moved version number out of config.inc.php and into a
	  version.inc, which provides a function to retrieve the version
	  number. Upped version to 1.2.4.

2006-10-09 15:54  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r737]
	  
	  * Added robots.txt and "Robots" META tag, to stop robots trawling
	  MRBS installations. Fixes SF bug tracker #1557192.
	  
	  * Improved documentation in AUTHENTICATION on LDAP auth method to
	  make it clear that the 'ldap' PHP extension is required. Fixes SF
	  bug tracker #1554351.
	  
	  * Fixes in auth_imap.inc to ensure that internet sockets to the
	  IMAP server are closed, in an attempt to fix a report in SF
	  tracker #1558451, though the reporter has since told me my fixes
	  didn't help his problem...
	  
	  * Fixed example setting of $ldap_filter in config.inc.php, it
	  showed $ldap_user_filter instead of $ldap_filter. Fixes SF bug
	  tracker #1550827.
	  
	  * Added a little code to turn $month, $week and $day into
	  integers explicitly, before calling checkdate(), this was
	  reported under SF tracker #1557192 as a place where MRBS will
	  output warnings (when being trawled by GoogleBot).
	  
	  * Added a check in edit_entry_handler.php to ensure that the
	  "Brief Description" is not empty. This will only happen if the
	  user doesn't have JavaScript turned on, as usually there is
	  JavaScript validation that you enter a description. Translators
	  note that I had to add two more vocab tokens.
	  
	  * Tidied HTML formatting - just the header section (for now).
	  
	  * Added updated Finnish translation as provided by Tom Ingberg in
	  SF tracker #1450459. The translation encoding has changed to
	  UTF-8, so anyone with a Finnish installation that sets
	  $unicode_encoding to 1 will need to run convert_db_to_utf8.php to
	  convert the text in their database from iso-8859-1 to UTF-8.
	  
	  * A few fixes to mysqli.inc that I'd not spotted in my earlier
	  testing.
	  
	  * A fix in session_php.inc to ensure that the user's password
	  gets unslashed(). Fixed SF bug tracker #1563470.
	  
	  * A few changes in trailer.inc so that the current day/week/month
	  in the trailer links are highlighted somewhat. Implements SF
	  feature request tracker # 875744.

2006-07-07 20:16  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r736]
	  
	  * Updated Spanish translation, as provided by SoTMaR.

2006-07-07 19:16  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r735]
	  
	  * Added 'mysqli' database abstraction, to allow PHP 5
	  installations to use the newer/better 'mysqli' extension instead
	  of 'mysql'. Reasonably tested on a Linux Apache 2.2.0/MySQL
	  5.0.18/PHP 5.1.2 installation. Updated the documentation to
	  mention the new database abstraction method, hopefully in all the
	  necessary places.

2006-04-26 10:15  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r733]
	  
	  * Fixed typo in comment in config.inc.php.

2006-04-26 10:01  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r732]
	  
	  * Upped version number to 1.2.3+cvs (rather belatedly)
	  
	  * Fixed some HTML escaping issues in the grids.
	  
	  * Fixed a problem whereby non-repeating entries wouldn't be
	  emailed to area/room admins. Fixes SF tracker #1474386, fix
	  provided by 'karcher'.
	  
	  * Added a little error logging into email functionality. You
	  should get an diagnostic error in your error log if an email
	  fails to be sent.
	  
	  * Fixed zh-tw translation to correctly specify its encoding as
	  utf-8.
	  
	  * Improved get_vocab() so that it doesn't do an iconv if the
	  language encoding is utf-8.
	  
	  * Fixed bug in report.php that meant the meeting end date was
	  shown when the start date should have been. This fix was provided
	  to me somehow, but I can't find who provided it...
	  
	  * Added "remote_user" session scheme, as provided by 'bwiberg' on
	  SF tracker #1432748. Allows MRBS to be configured to use a server
	  authentication scheme that sets the REMOTE_USER environment
	  variable.

2006-01-26 11:34  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r728]
	  
	  * Removed errant CRs from a few files.

2006-01-26 11:23  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r727]
	  
	  * Allow more entry types, now A-Z instead of A-J.
	  
	  * Fix in notifyAdminOnBooking, to fix SF tracker #1315854, as
	  supplied by Neville Gilbert. The fix ensures that the area
	  administrator is sent an email when a booking is created.
	  
	  * Improve server OS detection in language.inc. SunOS is now
	  handled, including utf-8 locale support.
	  
	  * Improved n-weekly repeat code, you can now do an n-weekly
	  repeating meeting that happens on a sunday. Calculation of which
	  days to create bookings on is now done more carefully. SF tracker
	  #1300974
	  
	  * Updated Swedish translation, as provided by Bjorn Wiberg in SF
	  tracker #1397719.
	  
	  * Fixed problem in report.php that would create an error if MRBS
	  was configured to use HTTP session handling and you clicked the
	  "You are ..." link. Provided by Bjorn Wiberg in SF tracker
	  #1396685.

2005-09-02 22:31  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r725]
	  
	  * Postgresql table creation fixed for Postgresql 8. Integer
	  columns can't have a DEFAULT of '', fixed this oversight.

2005-09-02 21:47  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r723]
	  
	  * Added ability to change the port of the LDAP server when the
	  'ldap' auth scheme is used. Set $ldap_port in config.inc.php to
	  change from the default port. * Added documentation for ldap port
	  configuration into AUTHENTICATION, along with some brief details
	  on the 'nis' auth scheme. * Tidied up some of the text in INSTALL
	  describing MRBS's i18n and l10n support. * Made checklang.php
	  work with register_globals off, and made the output prettier. *
	  Fixed a typo in a comment in config.inc.php * Added a missing $
	  in a Finnish vocab entry.

2005-09-02 10:42  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r722]
	  
	  * Bug fix for the SQL statement that generates the mrbs_users
	  table. Autoincrement columns don't need a DEFAULT, and if
	  specified with one on MySQL >= 4.1 the SQL statement fails. The
	  DEFAULT clause has been removed from the SQL.

2005-08-31 15:45  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r720]
	  
	  * Added German translation of site FAQ, courtesy of Bertold
	  Altaner.

2005-08-20 19:22  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r715]
	  
	  * Updated ChangeLogs and NEWS for 1.2.3 release.

2005-08-20 18:49  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r713]
	  
	  * Minor tidying.

2005-08-20 18:38  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r712]
	  
	  * Improved/fixed HTTP session scheme. It now also shows whether
	  the login box in the to banner, and shows who you're logged in
	  as. Tested it on my Linux box.
	  
	  * Minor tidying in a few files.

2005-08-20 09:46  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r711]
	  
	  * Improved db_ext auth scheme - moved the configuration into
	  config.inc.php, where it belongs. Additionally added support for
	  the password in the external database being in different formats,
	  namely one of: - MD5 - SHA1 - crypt - plaintext Also documented
	  the scheme in AUTHENTICATION, and added example config in
	  config.inc.php.
	  
	  * Fixes for cookie and php session schemes, username and password
	  as obtained from the web form are now 'unslashed' before being
	  stored and/or passed to the auth scheme. auth_db.inc updated to
	  escape the username being putting it in the database query.
	  
	  * Added site_faq_es.html, contributed by Carlos Insunza.

2005-07-13 10:30  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r710] web/lang.ko:
	  
	  * Added Korean translation, as contributed by YoungJoon Kim.

2005-06-10 08:54  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r709] web/lang.no:
	  
	  * Updated norwegian translation supplied by Emil Stoa.

2005-05-17 15:00  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r708]
	  
	  * A few improvements to db authentication system: - mrbs_users
	  table is now created with a 40 character wide password column.
	  Used to be 32 which was only just enough. This matches the column
	  width I made the trunk development MRBS use. - A message is now
	  shown at the top of the edit users page when the mrbs_users table
	  is empty that describes the situation and what to do. - After a
	  user entry is updated we now redirect the web browser back to the
	  edit users page, to discard the form arguments.

2005-05-11 10:59  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r706]
	  
	  * Update version number to 1.2.2+cvs

2005-05-11 10:03  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r704]
	  
	  * Added new authentication scheme, a result of support request
	  1199314. It queries a table in an external database for
	  username/password information. It's mysql only, and assumes the
	  password is stored in plaintext. Config values must be changed at
	  the top of the file too.

2005-04-28 20:44  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r702] web/edit_entry_handler.php:
	  
	  fixed incorrect comment

2005-04-22 10:57  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r700]
	  
	  * Update to NEWS file, I'd forgotton to fill in the names of the
	  contributors of updated Taiwanese and Japanese translations.

2005-04-22 10:45  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r699]
	  
	  * Updated ChangeLogs and NEWS files for 1.2.2 release.

2005-04-22 10:18  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r698]
	  
	  * Updated version number to 1.2.2.

2005-04-11 13:44  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r696]
	  
	  * Updated Taiwanese translation. Now stored in UTF-8 encoding.
	  Taiwanese users who have set $unicode_encoding to 0 will need to
	  convert their databases to UTF-8.

2005-04-11 13:40  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r695]
	  
	  * Updated Japanese translation. Now stored in UTF-8 encoding.
	  Japanese users who have set $unicode_encoding to 0 will need to
	  convert their databases to UTF-8.

2005-03-29 13:26  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r692]
	  
	  * Made username matching case insensitive throughout. Auth
	  schemes may still have case sensitive usernames though.
	  
	  * auth_config username matching made case insensitive.
	  
	  * Improved auth system, the session code doesn't need to return
	  the user password any more, and getAuthorised() now only requires
	  one parameter.
	  
	  * session_cookie.inc now deletes the cookie when the user logs
	  out. User password isn't stored in a cookie any more, which is
	  much more secure.
	  
	  * session_php.inc now creates a session for the directory MRBS is
	  run from, instead of assuming '/'. Additionally, session data is
	  deleted on log out, and the user's password isn't stored in the
	  session data any more.

2005-02-13 11:40  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r690] web/auth_config.inc, web/auth_db.inc, web/auth_ext.inc,
	  web/auth_imap.inc, web/auth_ldap.inc, web/auth_nis.inc,

	* [r650] web/functions_mail.inc:

2004-07-28 10:01  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r647] web/lang.cz, web/lang.da, web/lang.de, web/lang.el,

	  web/lang.zh-tw, web/language.inc:
	  
	  * Language tokens synchronised. All files now have the same
	  number of lines, and the same number of tokens. Some languages
	  are now missing quite a few translations.
	  
	  * Integrated fix for Windows locale selection contained in bug
	  #992390 (Huey). Browser language "en-ie" is now translated to the
	  correct Windows locale.

2004-06-29 13:04  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r646] web/functions.inc, web/language.inc:
	  
	  * locale setting fixes. Added ability to print warning at the top
	  of the screen if MRBS fails to set a locale. Added mapping into
	  Windows locale map of 'sv-se' to 'sve', this handles browsers set
	  to send 'sv-se'. Added mapping into Unix locale map of 'en_EN' to
	  'en_GB' to fix incorrect locale of 'en_EN' (I could have used
	  en_US instead). Added support for OS X into locale setting code.
	  OS X is treated as "unix".

2004-06-23 21:06  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r645] web/functions_mail.inc, web/lang.en, web/view_entry.php:
	  
	  Changed view_entry.php so that it could handle the situation
	  where an id for a series is passed to it. A series is identified
	  by series=1 in the url.
	  
	  Changed functions_mail.inc to generate urls with series=1 in the
	  email messages where the message relates to a series.
	  
	  Changed lang.en to have an error message for when an invalid
	  series id is passed to view_entry.php.

	  are more readable.

2004-06-15 19:43  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r639] web/mrbs.css:
	  
	  Changed default colour for odd row (TD.odd_row) so that it is not
	  the same as the default colour for TD.J

2004-06-14 21:34  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r638] web/session_cookie.inc:
	  
	  Fixes problem identifed by Dane where an invalid user will appear
	  to be logged in. This was caused by the cookie being set and no
	  validation of the user being done because the wrong variables
	  were being used. This is not a security issue.

2004-06-14 21:22  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r637] INSTALL, web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Changed comment about $url_base to recommend setting this if
	  email notifications are to be used.
	  
	  Fixed Bug 972186

2004-06-13 15:06  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r636] web/functions_mail.inc:
	  
	  - $endtime is declared as a global in notifyAdminOnBooking but it
	  is modified by being used as a "local" variable - renamed the
	  "local" variable Fixes bug #968682
	  
	  - use rep_type as more accurate indication of series or not, so
	  that $myendtime can be set the most appropriate value.

2004-06-12 10:38  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r635] web/day.php:
	  
	  Changing ordering of rooms in day view back to "by room name" as

	  config.inc.php 1.38

2004-06-12 08:34  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r633] web/auth_ldap.inc, web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Update auth_ldap.inc and config.inc.php. - LDAP servers may not
	  allow anon. bind so this broke the previous version of
	  auth_ldap.inc. I have removed the attempt at an anon. bind and
	  have given the admin more control over the dn that an auth. bind
	  is attempted with.
	  
	  - the user attribute can be defined individually for each base dn
	  if reequired.
	  
	  - $ldap_base_dn and $ldap_usesr_attrib are handled in a similar
	  way to imap and pop3, server and port, definitions, and
	  config.inic.php has been updated to reflect this.

2004-05-12 01:25  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r617] web/functions_mail.inc:
	  
	  - (sendMail()): forgot to add the 'To' header to mails. Some smtp
	  servers and sendmail may display 'undisclosed-recipients:

	* [r607] web/day.php:

	* [r595] web/edit_users.php, web/mysql.inc, web/pgsql.inc:
	  
	  Modified the way edit_users.php gets the user table fields names
	  and types. It now uses the three new routines sql_field_name,
	  sql_field_type, sql_num_fields, defined in mysql.inc and
	  pgsql.inc, which in turn call their corresponding
	  database-specific eponym. Still not tested with PostgreSQL, but
	  much more likely to work.

	  $vocab["click_to_reserve"] in lang.xx. It is passed from PHP to
	  JavaScript as an additional argument to routine InitActiveCell().

2004-04-18 17:14  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r593] web/day.php, web/month.php, web/mrbs.css, web/week.php,
	  web/xbLib.js:
	  
	  Added active highlighting of the month view cells. This required
	  an additional parameter in InitActiveCell(), hence the minor
	  changes in the day and week views. Side effect of this change:
	  The (+) sign in the month view is moved after the list of
	  reservations, instead of before. This was necessary, else the
	  list itself was moved to the bottom of the cell, which did not
	  look good.

2004-04-18 14:37  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r592] web/month.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  Include mrbs_auth.inc to allow the display of the logon box in
	  the MRBS top banner.

2004-04-17 15:28  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r591] web/report.php:
	  
	  - fixed bug $typematch, variable undefined

2004-04-17 00:50  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r590] ChangeLog, web/ChangeLog:
	  
	  ChangeLog update

2004-04-16 23:54  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r589] web/lang.el:
	  
	  Doc fix (it is a greek file, not english)

2004-04-16 22:22  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r588] web/day.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  I have changed the day and week view so that the colour key is
	  shown in both the "web page" view and "print preview". I believe
	  that it makes sense to include the key in the "print preview"
	  version so that you can understand the colours on a hardcopy.

2004-04-16 21:55  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r587] INSTALL, web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Doc fixes

2004-04-16 19:10  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r586] web/Mail/mail.php:
	  
	  - Removed PEAR_MAIL constants (never had).

2004-04-16 17:23  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r585] INSTALL, web/Mail, web/Mail.php, web/Mail/RFC822.php,
	  web/Mail/mail.php, web/Mail/null.php, web/Mail/sendmail.php,
	  web/Mail/smtp.php, web/Net, web/Net/SMTP.php, web/Net/Socket.php,
	  web/PEAR.php, web/config.inc.php, web/edit_entry_handler.php,
	  web/functions.inc, web/lang.en, web/mrbs_sql.inc,
	  web/view_entry.php:
	  
	  + Added email support to MRBS (using PEAR::Mail class for that).
	  MRBS developers, use function sendMail(), with at least the
	  minimal parameters ($recipients, $subject and $body) to send mail
	  from MRBS. + Added the option to notify the administrator (or
	  someone else) with an email on each new entry or new and changed
	  entries)

2004-04-15 11:08  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r584] web/auth_db.inc:
	  
	  - (authValidateUser): add global $tbl_users;

2004-04-14 22:27  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r583] INSTALL:
	  
	  Added instructions about using table name prefix to allow second
	  installations or resolve table name conflicts.

2004-04-14 22:18  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r582] destroy.pg.sql, grant.pg.sql, purge.my.sql, purge.pg.sql,
	  sample-data.sql, tables.my.sql, tables.pg.73and_above.sql,
	  tables.pg.sql:
	  
	  Added comment that user needs to fix table names if they have
	  changed the prefix that they wish to use.

2004-04-14 22:02  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r581] testdata.php, web/add.php, web/admin.php, web/auth_db.inc,
	  web/day.php, web/del.php, web/edit_area_room.php,
	  web/edit_entry.php, web/edit_entry_handler.php,
	  web/edit_users.php, web/functions.inc, web/index.php,
	  web/month.php, web/mrbs_sql.inc, web/report.php, web/search.php,
	  web/view_entry.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  Changed the fixed table names to variables. The variables are
	  defined in config.inc.php.

2004-04-14 21:57  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r580] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Added variables to allow the 'mrbs_' prefix on table names to be
	  changed. This will allow the user to do a second installation
	  when only one database is available or resolve table name
	  conflicts.

2004-04-14 16:34  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r579] web/day.php:
	  
	  - Correct the \\n new line character in tooltips to &#10; .
	  Currently it changes nothing but the HTML spec says \\n in titles
	  should be converted to spaces. So, the current thoughts of the
	  Mozilla developers is that &#10; would insert a line break in a
	  title, and a literal \\n would not, but they've not implemented
	  it yet though. However, IE _does_ currently work with &#10; and
	  that method seems to fit the specs much more closely. (John
	  Beranek)

2004-04-14 14:18  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r578] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Corrected the errors pointed out by Thierry. (Missing change from
	  his last commit, and authentication default changed by mistake)

2004-04-14 10:23  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r577] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  * Slight Unicode fix. Move page title specifier to _after_ page
	  encoding specifier. That way the browser knows what encoding the
	  title is in before it gets to it.

2004-04-14 09:33  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r576] web/config.inc.php, web/day.php, web/mrbs.css,
	  web/week.php, web/xbLib.js:
	  
	  Added an optional active cell highlighting, and the ability to
	  make a reservation by clicking anywhere in a cell. The control is
	  done in config.inc.php. Default is highlighting enabled; + signs
	  left in. The highligth color is defined in mrbs.css.
	  
	  Changed the background stripe generation method. Now defined be
	  classes in mrbs.css.

2004-04-14 09:23  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r575] web/language.inc:
	  
	  Fixed error when the server does not define
	  $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE.

2004-04-13 21:48  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r574] INSTALL, web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  + Doc fix.

2004-04-13 21:45  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r573] web/config.inc.php, web/month.php:
	  
	  + Added the option to show both time slots and brief description.

2004-04-13 03:13  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r572] web/report.php:
	  
	  + Added the 'creator' search criteria.

2004-04-12 21:22  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r571] web/day.php:
	  
	  added '' to minicals function call for room parameter as room is
	  not relevant in day context

2004-04-12 21:22  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r570] web/mrbs.css:
	  
	  added class for highlighting current month/week/day in calendars,
	  used in mincals.inc

2004-04-12 21:22  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r569] web/month.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  added $room to minicals function call

2004-04-12 21:22  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r568] web/mincals.inc:
	  
	  mincal changes: - correct week highlight code to correctly
	  highlight where a week crosses into a new month. The problem was
	  when crossing the year boundary, and where only the last day of
	  the week was in the new month and the number of days in the
	  current month was < 31. - week and month now include room in the
	  link thus maintaining the same room when using the calendars for
	  navigation - highlights whole month in month view - highlight
	  colour moved to mrbs.css

2004-04-11 22:34  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r566] web/auth_db.inc, web/session_cookie.inc,
	  web/session_php.inc:
	  
	  + Add link to user entries for all auth schemes, not only db
	  (thanks Gavin!).

2004-04-11 20:32  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r565] web/month.php:
	  
	  Added 'plus sign' next to date in month view.
	  
	  This will take the user to an add entry page for that day of the
	  month.

2004-04-11 13:12  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r564] web/auth_db.inc, web/lang.en, web/lang.fr, web/report.php,
	  web/session_cookie.inc, web/session_php.inc:
	  
	  + If auth_db is used with session_cookie or session_php, the
	  message "you are XXXX" becomes a link to all upcoming entries
	  belonging to XXXX (report page). If auth_db is not used, the
	  previous empty HREF link "you are XXXX" is useless and is now a
	  simple text message.

2004-04-10 05:12  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r563] web/edit_users.php:
	  
	  - Changed the title displayed when adding new user from 'Edit
	  user' to 'Add a new user'.

2004-04-10 04:52  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r562] web/auth_db.inc, web/edit_users.php:
	  
	  + Hashes passwords in dababase (auth_db). Update 'password' field
	  for this purpose.

2004-04-10 03:26  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r561] web/lang.cz, web/lang.da, web/lang.de, web/lang.el,
	  web/lang.en, web/lang.es, web/lang.fi, web/lang.fr, web/lang.it,
	  web/lang.ja, web/lang.nl, web/lang.no, web/lang.pt, web/lang.sv,
	  web/lang.zh-tw, web/month.php, web/report.php,
	  web/view_entry.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  Removed punctuation from $vocab["room"] string so that this vocab
	  can be used more often and lessen the number of vocabs (replace
	  $vocab["sort_rep_room"]). This could be done in all vocabs too,
	  as a general rule we should not use punctuation and other things
	  not related to translation in these strings.

2004-04-09 21:19  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r560] AUTHENTICATION, web/auth_imap.inc, web/auth_pop3.inc,
	  web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  This change allows multiple pop3 or imap server to be used for
	  authentication.
	  
	  AUTHENTICATION has been updated to explain this and users are
	  referred to AUTHENTICATION from config.inc.php if they wish to
	  use multiple servers.

2004-04-08 21:20  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r556] web/functions.inc, web/lang.en, web/report.php:
	  
	  This includes an update to reporting to allow reports to be
	  sorted by Area/Room then Start Date/Time or Start Date/Time then
	  Area/Room.
	  
	  There is also now the option to display Start and End date/time
	  instead of start date/time and duration.
	  
	  A modification has been made to period_date_string in
	  functions.inc to make the display start/end dates and periods
	  clearer.

2004-04-07 04:45  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r555] AUTHENTICATION, INSTALL, web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Doc fixes (added DB doc)

2004-04-07 02:02  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r554] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Updating mrbs version number before next release :-)

2004-04-07 01:57  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r553] ChangeLog, web/ChangeLog, web/month.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  ChangeLog update Doc fixes.

2004-04-05 13:16  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r546] web/lang.el, web/style.inc:
	  
	  * Added Greek translation, lang.el
	  
	  * Fixed global variable problem in style.inc, $vocab wasn't being
	  declared as a global.
	  
	  [Translation and fix provided by Stavros Papadakis]

2004-03-24 21:47  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r545] INSTALL:
	  
	  Doc fix

2004-03-15 22:54  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r544] web/functions.inc, web/month.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  This change means that the default room in an area, if none is
	  specified or when changing areas will be the first listed rather
	  than the room with the lowest id.
	  
	  This also affects the choice of area if no room or area is
	  specified then the first listed area will be chosen rather than
	  the one with the lowest id.

2004-03-15 22:24  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r543] web/config.inc.php, web/index.php:
	  
	  Added configuration option to allow index.php to redirect to a
	  specific room.

2004-03-10 04:27  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r542] web/day.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  Added specific Room Description showing with a pop up/hover title
	  for each room on the week view link in day.php and room link in
	  week.php. (Valeria Montesi/Gareth T).

2004-03-08 14:24  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r538] web/edit_users.php:
	  
	  The last change, to restrict access to the page to identified
	  users, broke the ability to initially enter the first user! Fixed
	  this by avoiding to do this test if the user list is empty.
	  Actually moved the code to a branch that already ran only if the
	  user list was not empty.

2004-02-27 01:17  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r521] web/mrbs_sql.inc:
	  
	  (mrbsCheckFree): - corrected 'undefined variable' bug (typo on
	  variable name line 54, $enable_period instead of $enable_periods)

2004-02-11 13:55  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r520] web/index.php:
	  
	  - included grab_globals.inc.php at the top of the file otherwise
	  $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is undefined

2004-02-04 15:21  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r518] web/mrbs_sql.inc, web/report.php:
	  
	  * Removed 3 uses of %T format specifier in strftime() calls, as
	  it seems Windows strftime() doesn't support %T. Tested on a
	  Windows MRBS (Apache + MySQL) installation. Problem reported by
	  Reinhold Petrich on the mailing list, and fix also confirmed.

2004-02-04 15:13  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r517] web/mincals.inc:
	  
	  Use basename($PHP_SELF) to avoid false hits, if the substrings
	  "day" or "week" or "month" appear in the full URL.

2004-02-02 17:35  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r516] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  * Fixed JavaScript in functions.inc (for area and room drop-down
	  menus in day/week/month view) to use relative URLs, and better
	  "onChange" handling.

2004-01-31 08:51  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r514] web/language.inc:
	  
	  Updated the iconv error message, based on the suggestion by David
	  Watts.

2004-01-31 07:53  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r513] web/edit_users.php:
	  
	  Make sure the user is authenticated before giving him access to
	  the list.

2004-01-28 23:01  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r511] web/config.inc.php, web/index.php:
	  
	  Added $default_view as suggested by Warren Turkal This can be
	  used to determine the default starting view, i.e. month, week or
	  day, as used by index.php.

2004-01-27 22:29  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r510] web/report.php:
	  
	  BUG 885333 - fixed - added check to ensure that
	  $typematch_default is an array.

2004-01-26 06:31  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r505] web/edit_entry.php:
	  
	  When the user clicks on the "All day" checkbox, use JavaScript to
	  immediately change the time to 00:00 and the duration to 1 day.
	  (Designed for support of periods too, but not tested)

2004-01-22 22:33  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r500] web/edit_users.php:
	  
	  Removed the paragliding-specific weight field :-)

2004-01-22 22:28  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r499] web/config.inc.php, web/day.php:
	  
	  Added the ability to display horizontal bands of color in the
	  background of the day view, to make the table more readable. This
	  is enabled by changing the new setting $stripe_color in
	  config.inc.php. This value sets the color class for the bands.
	  "white"= no bands (default) For example changing it to "J"
	  display light gray bands.

2004-01-22 21:35  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r498] INSTALL:
	  
	  Previous commit truncated file - adding back in missing lines

2004-01-22 04:05  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r497] web/config.inc.php, web/day.php, web/lang.cz, web/lang.da,
	  web/lang.de, web/lang.en, web/lang.es, web/lang.fi, web/lang.fr,
	  web/lang.it, web/lang.ja, web/lang.nl, web/lang.no, web/lang.pt,
	  web/lang.sv, web/lang.zh-tw, web/week.php:
	  
	  + Option to display times on right side in day and week view. +
	  pop-up messages

2004-01-21 22:36  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r496] web/lang.en, web/report.php:
	  
	  Allows reports to be limited to certain reservation types (eg
	  just 'external'). This is multiple select box. If all are
	  selected or none are selected then all reservation types are
	  included in the report.

2004-01-21 22:16  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r495] INSTALL, web/config.inc.php, web/day.php,
	  web/edit_entry.php, web/edit_entry_handler.php,
	  web/functions.inc, web/lang.en, web/month.php, web/mrbs_sql.inc,
	  web/report.php, web/search.php, web/view_entry.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  This update contains all of the code and documentation to support
	  "periods" within mrbs.

2004-01-20 19:30  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r494] web/day.php:
	  
	  + Added link to rooms heading to display the weekly view for that
	  room.

2004-01-19 23:40  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r492] ChangeLog, web/ChangeLog:
	  
	  ChangeLog update.

2004-01-19 21:31  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r491] web/auth_db.inc, web/config.inc.php, web/edit_users.php,
	  web/lang.en, web/lang.fr, web/mrbs.css, web/session_cookie.inc,
	  web/session_php.inc:
	  
	  Added a new authentication module auth_db.inc. This is a
	  web-based authentication, based on a new table of users in the
	  mrbs database. Implements RFE #665239 "Multiuser, Web based
	  auth". Added module edit_users.php to manage the contents of this
	  table. New English and French strings added in lang.en and
	  lang.fr respectively. Added in session_php.inc and
	  session_cookie.inc logon box an optional link to the user list
	  management page. Finally minor changes to config.inc.php
	  (comment) and mrbs.css (style for buttons inside tables).

2004-01-15 22:37  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r485] web/language.inc:
	  
	  Updated the error message displayed in the case where the iconv
	  extension is missing.

2004-01-15 21:01  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r484] web/config.inc.php, web/session_cookie.inc,
	  web/session_php.inc, web/trailer.inc:
	  
	  Changed absolute paths in anchor hrefs and redirection headers
	  from absolute to relative. This should fix the link failures seen
	  by some users, in environments where a proxy makes the
	  user-visible root different from the web-server-visible root. In
	  the unlikely case where some users have a very old browser not
	  supporting relative HTTP relocation headers, then they can use
	  the $url_base in config.inc.php as a workaround: In this case,
	  put in this variable the full URL of the MRBS root, as seen by
	  the users through the proxy.

2004-01-15 20:39  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r483] web/month.php:
	  
	  - Fixed bug [ 875782 ]: Month View, Extra carriage return. Text
	  formating problem if $monthly_view_brief_description set to TRUE.

2004-01-11 21:52  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r482] web/mrbs.css:
	  
	  Added a directive to avoid having a blank line below buttons
	  inside tables. This makes the logon cell in the top banner, and
	  the forthcoming user properties editor page, look much better.

2004-01-11 15:26  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r481] INSTALL:
	  
	  Doc fix: unlike Apache on Windows, you HAVE to copy iconv.dll in
	  into \\%windir%\\system32\\ if you use Microsoft IIS.

2004-01-09 09:40  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r480] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  * The MRBS version number hadn't been updated to 1.2-pre2. It has
	  now.

2003-12-22 23:12  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r479] web/edit_entry.php, web/lang.en:
	  
	  Added support for changing area/room in Add/Edit entry form.
	  Added check to ensure that at least one room is selected as
	  edit_entry_handler.php does not catch this. Added wording to
	  lang.en to cover the above check.
	  
	  The first fix requires that javascript is enabled. If it is not
	  then you get the same form as you get currently. If it is enabled
	  and you have more than one area then you get an area select box
	  which controls the rooms displayed in the room select box.

2003-12-22 21:52  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r478] web/day.php:

	  works now with Gavin changes

2003-12-21 11:05  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r476] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Changed the default administrator list, to be coherent with the
	  explanations in AUTHENTICATION, and also to work out-of-the-box.

2003-12-21 11:03  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r475] AUTHENTICATION:
	  
	  Added a few comments from last weeks emails on the list. Changed
	  the information about the default administrator settings, which
	  was incoherent with the default contents of config.inc.php.

2003-12-17 22:03  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r474] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  Modified Javascript to work with Mozilla 1.5 (Linux) and NS4
	  (Linux), also tested with Konqueror 3.1.4 and IE 6.0
	  
	  Days now work for all changes of Month and Year.
	  
	  Added JavaScript to fix days once date selector is displayed so
	  that if a month has < 31 days then the day selector is shortened
	  appropriately.

	* [r471] web/functions.inc:
	  
	  (print_header): Added JavaScript to insure the integrity of the
	  date entered in three field drop-down menus.
	  
	  Tested with Windows IE 6.0 Tested with Linux Opera 7.21, Mozilla
	  1.3, Konqueror 3.1.0
	  
	  WARNING: little bug in Mozilla 1.3. If a month with less than 31
	  days is selected, the max days number is updated correctly, but
	  if you select a 31 days month again, then max days number is not
	  updated (ie. stays at 30 or 28). Goto a 31 days month to have the
	  31 days back. Since Mozilla 1.3 is rather not up to date (1.6b
	  current at 2003-11-15), this may be corrected in newer releases.

	  - Fixed bug #846337: We can create rooms with no area

2003-12-03 21:52  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r457] web/day.php, web/edit_entry.php,
	  web/edit_entry_handler.php, web/functions.inc, web/month.php,
	  web/mrbs_sql.inc, web/view_entry.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  Daylight Saving Time fixes.
	  
	  This has involved modifying month.php, week.php and day.php,
	  view_entry.php, edit_entry.php, edit_entry_handler.php,
	  mbs_sql.inc and functions.inc
	  
	  For month.php and week.php, I have changed them to handle each
	  week/month on a day by day basis. They and day.php make DST
	  corrections for the start and end of each day. The intervals of
	  time are handled by using the format HHMM with no leading zeros.
	  Events are read in to an array using this format of time as the
	  one of the indices. A day which does not include a DST change is
	  used to loop through all valid hours for that day.
	  
	  The view_entry.php has been altered to modify times that cross
	  DST back to what the user would expect 9pm to 3am is 6 hours but
	  it is stored as either 5 or 7 hours.
	  
	  The edit_entry.php, edit_entry_handler.php and mrbs_sql.inc have
	  been changed to correctly calculate the difference between two
	  timestamps and correct the end time for checking the following:
	  free time, all day events and repeating events.
	  
	  functions.inc includes two new functions: one to check for DST
	  and one to correct for DST. These are used in the fixes above.
	  
	  Where possible, calculations that used to use midnight have been
	  changed to use midday to avoid DST problems.
	  
	  You may still see some "strange" but correct behaviour when
	  scheduling meetings which start and/or end between midnight and 3
	  am on a day of DST. These may look wrong but should actually be
	  correct if you consider how DST works on that day, i.e in the UK
	  the hour from 1am to 2pm does not exist when entering DST.
	  
	  Backward compatibility: There may be a one hour error for events
	  that start or end between midnight and 3am on the day that DST
	  changes but these can be fixed by editting the entry/series and
	  saving it.

2003-12-03 18:22  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r456] ChangeLog, web/ChangeLog:
	  
	  Changelog update.

2003-12-03 18:16  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r455] INSTALL, README, tables.pg.73and_above.sql:
	  
	  ° Updated documentation about new authentication features. °
	  Updated documentation to add warnings about mrbs not working with
	  postegreSQL version 7.3 and above.
	  
	  Mrbs does not work anymore with postgreSQL dbms since pgsql
	  version 7.3. This is because the following changes : - An empty
	  string ('') is no longer allowed as the input into an integer
	  field. Formerly, it was silently interpreted as 0. If you want a
	  field to be 0 then explicitly use 0, if you want it to be
	  undefined then use NULL. - "INSERT" statements with column lists
	  must specify all values; e.g., INSERT INTO tab (col1, col2)
	  VALUES ('val1') is now invalid.
	  
	  This is a problem since we have to change all sql logic that
	  works fine with mysql just to be compliant with postGreSQL. Since
	  nobody reported this error, I can thinks mrbs users using pgsql
	  are very few. Currently the new tables.pg.73and_above.sql file
	  allow to create mrbs tables with new postgreSQL versions, but is
	  experimental. You can still browse existing mrbs tables with new
	  versions, but you cannot add/edit entries/rooms/areas any more.

2003-12-03 18:05  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r454] pgsql.before_php42.inc, web/pgsql.inc:
	  
	  Updated the postgreSql driver (pgsql.inc) to remove deprecated
	  functions. People which still use a php version less than 4.2
	  will have to replace the existing pgsql.inc file with
	  pgsql.before_php42.inc file and rename it to pgsql.inc

2003-12-01 22:05  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r453] AUTHENTICATION:
	  
	  Complete rewrite of the file in html. Converted to text using
	  detagger (http://www.jafsoft.com/detagger/)

2003-11-24 22:11  Gavin Walker <gwalker@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r452] web/edit_entry.php:
	  
	  Displays "Edit Series" or "Edit Entry" at top of page when
	  editing a series or entry respectively.

2003-11-22 15:11  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r451] ROXEN[DEL]:
	  
	  This file described how to operate the old cookie authentication
	  module.

2003-11-22 09:40  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r450] auth_cookie_ext.inc[DEL]:
	  
	  As Thierry pointed-out, this file is now useless, as there is a
	  more general implementation in web/session_cookie.inc.

2003-11-21 15:27  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r449] web/config.inc.php, web/help.php:
	  
	  Since we always forgot for each release to update mrbs version in
	  help.php (this is not a file we open often), I moved the variable
	  to config.inc.php.

2003-11-21 04:19  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r445] web/ChangeLog:
	  
	  ChangeLog update.

2003-11-21 01:34  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r444] web/session_cookie.inc:
	  
	  - fixed not working with error level all.

2003-11-19 23:18  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r443] web/auth_ip.inc[DEL], web/auth_name.inc[DEL],
	  web/auth_nt.inc[DEL], web/auth_omni.inc[DEL]:
	  
	  Removed auth_ip.inc, auth_name.inc, auth_nt.inc, auth_omni.inc,
	  now superseeded by session_ip.inc, session_host.inc,
	  session_nt.inc, and session_omni.inc respectively.

2003-11-19 23:09  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r442] web/auth_none.inc, web/config.inc.php,
	  web/session_host.inc, web/session_ip.inc, web/session_nt.inc,
	  web/session_omni.inc:
	  
	  Created an auth_none.inc authentication, which validates any
	  user. Moved session management code from the old auth_ip,
	  auth_name, auth_nt, auth_omni to the new session_ip,
	  session_host, session_nt, session_omni respectively. Updated
	  config.inc.php comments to reflect the possible choices for
	  session name and authentication types.

2003-11-18 21:30  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r441] web/language.inc:
	  
	  Updated the administrator warning message about the iconv package
	  requirement, to fire only if $unicode_encoding is true.

2003-11-18 10:41  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r440] convert_db_to_utf8.php, web/style.inc:
	  
	  * Added utility to convert text in the database to UTF8, to use
	  MRBS with $unicode_encoding set to 1. The administrator should
	  copy it into the web directory, run it (choosing the encoding to
	  convert from) ONCE, and then move it back out of the web
	  directory.
	  
	  * Added comment to my usage of $vocab["charset"] in style.inc, as
	  ist doesn't match the general usage of get_vocab().

2003-11-17 03:52  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r439] ChangeLog, web/ChangeLog:
	  
	  ChangeLog update.

2003-11-17 03:41  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r438] web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  Removed unnecessary comment.

2003-11-17 03:39  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r437] web/admin.php:
	  
	  - make admin.php working with error level E_ALL with no area/room
	  defined (previous fix causes an error in case http authentication
	  fail).

2003-11-17 03:30  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r436] web/lang.fr:
	  
	  Changing $vocab language string.

2003-11-16 20:25  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

2003-11-16 19:41  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r434] web/month.php:
	  
	  - fixed remainings non unicode compliant php functions.

2003-11-16 19:23  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r432] web/admin.php:

2003-11-16 17:10  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r431] web/config.inc.php, web/month.php:
	  
	  Changed my stupid $_MRBS_monthly_view_brief_description variable
	  name to $monthly_view_brief_description

2003-11-15 20:37  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r430] web/ChangeLog:
	  
	  ChangeLog update.

2003-11-14 22:26  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r429] web/day.php:
	  
	  Moved inclusion of mrbs_auth.inc after that of function.inc and
	  $dbsys.inc, as mrbs_auth.inc now uses definitions of the first
	  one, and will use those of the second one eventually.

2003-11-14 22:23  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r428] web/auth_config.inc:
	  
	  Function authValidateUser() must not call authGet() anymore. In
	  case of failure it just returns 0 as specified in its header
	  comment.

2003-11-14 22:20  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r427] web/auth_ext.inc, web/auth_imap.inc, web/auth_ldap.inc,
	  web/auth_nis.inc, web/auth_nw.inc, web/auth_pop3.inc:
	  
	  Set $auth['session']='http' if it is not specified. This allows
	  to get the same behaviour as before without changing
	  config.inc.php. Moved routines authGet(), getUserName() and
	  getUserPassword() to the new session_http.inc module. Function
	  authValidateUser() must not call authGet() anymore. In case of
	  failure it just returns 0 as specified in its header comment.

2003-11-14 22:13  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r426] web/auth_ip.inc, web/auth_name.inc, web/auth_nt.inc,
	  web/auth_omni.inc:
	  
	  Removed the argument to authGet().

2003-11-14 22:07  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r425] web/mrbs_auth.inc:
	  
	  Moved routines getAuthUserName() and getAuthUserPassword() to the
	  new session_http.inc module. Function getAuthorized() must not
	  call authGet() anymore. In case of failure it just returns 0 as
	  specified in its header comment.

2003-11-14 22:01  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r424] web/session_cookie.inc, web/session_php.inc:
	  
	  Moved $HTTP_HOST setting to grab_globals.inc. Added missing
	  globals declarations. Removed the argument to authGet(). Action
	  "SetName" now validates the user/password pair. This avoids
	  loging on unauthorized users, which would rejected later on.

2003-11-14 21:52  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r423] web/session_http.inc:
	  
	  Get the user/password using the HTTP basic authentication.

2003-11-14 21:47  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r422] web/grab_globals.inc.php:

	  E_ALL.

2003-11-12 03:24  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r419] README:
	  
	  Added warning about using php accelerators with mrbs.

2003-11-11 21:59  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	  web/lang.no, web/lang.pt, web/lang.sv, web/lang.zh-tw:
	  
	  Added messages for session handling.

2003-11-09 22:49  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	  web/functions.inc, web/lang.en, web/mrbs_auth.inc,
	  web/session_cookie.inc, web/session_php.inc:
	  
	  Added support for session handling.

2003-11-09 10:58  Jean-Francois LARVOIRE <jflarvoire@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r416] web/language.inc:
	  
	  Display an error message when the iconv function is not defined.
	  This message explains what to do to fix the problem on the PHP
	  server. It will help administrators who are likely to encounter
	  the problem the first time they install mrbs.

2003-11-01 21:12  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r415] ChangeLog, web/ChangeLog:

2003-11-01 21:06  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r414] web/day.php, web/month.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  + Time slots with an entry now display bubbles when mouse over,
	  showing complete description in day view and week view, and
	  either the short name or start-stop time in month view in
	  accordance with $_MRBS_monthly_view_brief_description value in

2003-10-11 03:32  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r408] ChangeLog, web/ChangeLog:
	  
	  ChangeLog update.

2003-10-11 02:46  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r407] testdata.php:
	  
	  - bug fix: Make testdata compliant to register_global=off
	  (samples entries had no authors)

2003-10-10 19:26  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r405] web/language.inc:
	  
	  - Changed getenv('HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE') to
	  $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE. getenv() does not work in ISAPI mode, so
	  getenv('HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE') is always NULL with ISAPI. Global
	  variable seems more reliable.

2003-10-10 04:54  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r404] web/ChangeLog, web/config.inc.php:
	  
	  + Allow to view weeks in the bottom (trailer.inc) as week numbers
	  (ie. 42) instead of 'first day of the week' (13 Oct). Committing
	  again since John previous commit erased my changes :-)

2003-10-10 04:31  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r403] web/ChangeLog:
	  
	  + new Unicode support (John).

2003-10-09 20:07  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r402] web/ChangeLog:
	  
	  * Just testing new CVS loginfo

2003-10-09 19:58  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r401] web/admin.php, web/config.inc.php, web/day.php,
	  web/del.php, web/edit_area_room.php, web/edit_entry.php,
	  web/edit_entry_handler.php, web/functions.inc, web/help.php,
	  web/language.inc, web/mincals.inc, web/month.php,
	  web/mrbs_auth.inc, web/mrbs_sql.inc, web/mysql.inc,
	  web/pgsql.inc, web/report.php, web/search.php, web/style.inc,
	  web/trailer.inc, web/view_entry.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  * Revamped localisation/internationalisation. MRBS can now be
	  called fulled Unicode, as long as the config variable
	  $unicode_encoding is set to 1. If this is set, then MRBS serves
	  all of it's pages in UTF-8 and stores everything in the database
	  in UTF-8. This means that all languages work together. Other
	  things fixed:
	  
	  - Automatic language determination made much better, works for
	  Windows and Unix servers now, by using different code for each.
	  
	  - There are new configuration variables in config.inc.php now, to
	  configure language/locale settings with much more flexibility.
	  
	  Tested on a Windows+Apache machine, and on a Linux+Apache machine
	  
	  NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
	  
	  Whenever you want to access the translations you MUST now use:
	  get_vocab('token') instead of $vocab[token]
	  
	  Additionally, if you use a call to date() or strftime() that
	  could return text, as opposed to just numbers, you MUST use
	  utf8_date() and utf8_strftime() instead.
	  
	  Note: Not filled out ChangeLog, because I don't know how (or if)
	  Thierry does it automatically, and I wasn't gonna do it by hand
	  with all the files I changed :)

2003-10-03 17:46  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	  cvs2cl.pl --revisions --branches --tags --gmt --ignore ChangeLog
	  --usermap /path/to/your/username_email_file --file ChangeLog
	  --window 43200 --FSF

	  not have 'atomic' entries in the file.

2003-08-07 05:07  Thierry Bothorel <thierry_bo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r378] NEWS:
	  
	  * Added a NEWS file which contains a list of user-visible changes

	  except last CVS entries which should go to the ChangeLog file.

2003-01-10 12:43  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r317] ChangeLog:
	  
	  * Corrected ChangeLog. Daniel's 2 latest changes didn't make it
	  into 1.1-pre2.

2003-01-10 11:33  Daniel <nambit@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r316] ChangeLog, web/search.php:

	  Change trailer.inc to make print preview more likely to work on
	  windows and non-apache servers

2003-01-09 17:48  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r314] ChangeLog:
	  
	  * Modified ChangeLog to show changes for soon to be released

2002-11-28 10:24  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r310] ChangeLog, web/admin.php, web/edit_entry.php:
	  
	  * Fix for edit entry page. We now determine the area id of the
	  room the meeting we're editting is in before getting a list of
	  the rooms in that area. This solves a number of errors that occur
	  when editting/creating bookings. [Note: this is the bug that has
	  been reported by multiple people on the mailing list.]

2002-10-14 15:45  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r309] ChangeLog, web/admin.php, web/del.php,
	  web/edit_area_room.php, web/index.php, web/style.inc:

	  - Added closing ?> to index.php - Added "global $refresh_rate;"
	  to style.inc - Fixed all occurences (hopefully) of $vocab[]
	  indices written without surrounding quotes.

2002-10-09 11:44  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r308] ChangeLog:
	  
	  * Minor change to ChangeLog.

2002-10-08 13:19  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r307] ChangeLog, smb_auth.c, web/admin.php, web/auth_ext.inc,
	  web/config.inc, web/edit_area_room.php, web/edit_entry.php,
	  web/escapeshellarg.inc, web/functions.inc, web/help.php,
	  web/index.php, web/lang.cz, web/lang.de, web/lang.en,
	  web/lang.es, web/lang.fr, web/lang.it, web/lang.ja, web/lang.nl,
	  web/lang.no, web/lang.sv, web/lang.zh-tw, web/mincals.inc,
	  web/mrbs_auth.inc, web/report.php, web/search.php, web/style.inc,
	  web/view_entry.php:
	  
	  - Changed all uses of <? to <?php.
	  
	  - Merged change from John Beranek for an Advanced search
	  function, requires 3 more translation tokens, which have been
	  added to each language file, "search_button" should be OK, as I
	  took the text from each language's "search" token.
	  
	  - Fixed 2 problems in edit_entry.php as submitted on the mailing
	  list.
	  
	  - Added small enchancement to smb_auth.c, if you pass a username
	  as group/user, it will change the NT group that is used for
	  authentication.
	  
	  - Improved shell escaping in auth_ext.inc. It now uses
	  escapeshellarg() instead of escapeshellcmd(). If your PHP version
	  is less than 4.0.3, then it includes escapeshellarg.inc which is
	  a local implementation of that function.
	  
	  - Added updated Frech translation, as provided by Thierry Wehr.
	  
	  - Tided all language files again, they all have the same format
	  and number of lines now, and are all missing at least 2
	  translations because of the new advanced search functionality.
	  
	  - Fixed a number of bugs to make the Taiwanese translation work.
	  The code to include language files based on HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
	  has been improved, which ensures lang.zh-tw is included.
	  Additionally, mincals.inc not longer does a substr() on the
	  abbreviated weekday names, as this breaks terribly for any
	  multibyte encoding, as it was only taking the first byte of a
	  multibyte encoding. This has the impact that you now get
	  Mon,Tue,Wed etc instead of M,T,W (using glibc's en_GB locale).
	  
	  - print_header() now outputs a DOCTYPE identifier as well as
	  sending Pragma: no-cache and an Expires: header in the past. This
	  should help ensure the calendar pages don't get cached.

	  * Added new or updated translations for: Italy (Gianni)
	  Netherlands (Marc ter Horst) Norway (Rune Johansen) Sweden (Hakan
	  Nilsson) German (Michael Redinger)
	  
	  * Added auth_imap.inc, an authentication scheme that uses IMAP,
	  this includes a few more (commented out) lines in config.inc
	  
	  * Changed datatype of 'rep_num_weeks' in 'mrbs_repeat' table for
	  PostgreSQL installs. We now use smallint instead of tinyint, as
	  tinyint isn't available.
	  
	  * Changed config.inc to use getenv('HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE')
	  instead of $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE...much tidier.

2001-11-02 12:57  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r282] ChangeLog, web/config.inc:
	  
	  * Fixed problem in config.inc, $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE wasn't
	  working for me unless I put a global specification for it. This
	  should improve internationalisation.

2001-08-30 21:27  Daniel <nambit@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r280] ChangeLog:
	  
	  updated for 1.0

2001-07-16 08:44  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r279] upgrade2.my.sql, upgrade2.pg.sql:
	  
	  * Added these upgrade SQL files. Don't know how I forgot to add

	  * Removed a little debug code that I left in accidentally.

2001-07-02 16:58  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r276] web/style.inc:
	  
	  * Missed a bit in previous checkin, because I have multiple MRBS
	  trees, ahem.

2001-07-02 15:05  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r275] ChangeLog, tables.my.sql, tables.pg.sql,
	  web/auth_ldap.inc, web/config.inc, web/day.php,
	  web/edit_entry.php, web/edit_entry_handler.php,
	  web/functions.inc, web/lang.de, web/lang.en, web/lang.es,

	  web/lang.zh-tw, web/mrbs_sql.inc, web/style.inc,
	  web/view_entry.php, web/week.php:
	  
	  * Incorporated diff from Scott Leonard that allows you to
	  configure a refresh time for roombooker web pages. Set config
	  variable $refresh_rate to the number of seconds to refresh after,
	  or set to 0 to disable.
	  
	  * Implemented "n-weekly" repeat type. Not sure I like the way
	  it's phrased in the lang files, but the code works fine. You can
	  now a meeting that is repeated every 'n' weeks. e.g. every 5th
	  Monday. This required a database change, which I've made
	  available in upgrade2.my.sql and upgrade2.pg.sql
	  
	  * Tidied lang files, and ensured every file has all the required
	  tokens. 'wc -l lang.*' now shows all the files as having the same
	  line count. Quite a few languages now have English bits in them
	  though.
	  
	  * Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that allow you to configure a
	  filter for LDAP authentication.
	  
	  * Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that solve problems with
	  bookings made for times that have smaller granularity that the
	  configured booking resolution.

	  * Fixed config.inc so that the correct lang.xx is included if
	  HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is a comma-seperated list like "sv, en".

2001-03-26 14:02  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r272] ChangeLog, web/lang.es, web/lang.sv:
	  
	  * Copied "rep_type_5" language token into Swedish and Spanish
	  language files from English file. Swedish and Spanish users were
	  not able to use "monthly, corresponding day" repeats without the
	  token being present.

2001-03-18 18:07  Michael Redinger <mred@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r271] web/lang.de, web/lang.en, web/lang.es, web/lang.fr,
	  web/lang.ja, web/lang.nl, web/lang.sv, web/lang.zh-tw,
	  web/trailer.inc:
	  
	  Added language string for print preview; added it to all lang
	  files, but only german was translated - the rest still has the
	  english string.

	  web/lang.es, web/lang.fr, web/lang.ja, web/lang.nl, web/lang.sv,
	  web/lang.zh-tw:
	  
	  * Internationalised functions.inc. "Help", "Admin" and "Search:"
	  are now lang strings. Also, fixed an error in lang.fr,
	  $lang["mrbs"] was defined twice.

2001-02-26 10:51  John Beranek <jberanek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r261] ChangeLog, web/day.php, web/edit_entry.php,
	  web/functions.inc, web/mincals.inc, web/month.php,
