-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.9.1 (Sat 10th October 2020):

[+] Added the ability to request a password reset, as long as MRBS can determine the user's
 email address.

[+] Added ability to configure a meeting to allow for a set number of users to "sign up"
 for the meeting.

[-] Fixed bug recently introduced in LDAP authentication scheme, see SF Bugs #475.

[-] Fixed bug with error logging, see SF Support Requests #2312.

[*] Now respects the sort key when getting the default area.

[*] Updated German translation with thanks to Tobias Zeumer.

[*] Improvements to utility page checklang.php.

[*] Added version parameters to query strings for Javascript and CSS files to
 avoid problems with over-eager caching.

[-] Fixed bug causing no entries to be found in a report when there's a
 custom field which is an integer and it is left blank in the report
 form. See SF Support Requests #2142.

[*] Upgraded to latest version of DataTables.

[-] Fixed SF Bugs #477 - CAS setup error.

[*] Added checks where necessary that the authentication type is the
 same as the session scheme.

[-] Fixed SF Bugs #479 (cannot edit a booking when
 $prevent_simultaneous_bookings = true;)

[-] Fixed bug when a limit is set on both the maximum number and also
 the total length of bookings per day. See SF Bugs #480.

 main calendar when the window narrrows. See SF Support Requests
 #2156.

[+] Allowed admins to override the private_mandatory setting. See SF
 Patches #102.

[-] Fixed bug causing the location not to be shown in print view. See SF
 Feature Requests #426.

[*] Fixed minimum version requirements. See SF Support Requests #1671.

[-] Reduced the VARCHAR size to avoid running into the limit on the size

 should be more than enough for this field. (Strictly speaking we
 don't need really need utf8mb4, but it keeps tings simpler using it
 throughout).

[-] Fixed problem with $skip_default config setting not being
 recognised. See SF Bugs #434.

[-] Fixed bug in bulk deletion of entries from the report page.

[-] Fixed a bug that occasionally (especially on slow connections)

 to expire.

[*] Upgraded PHPMailer to Version 5.2.27.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.7.1 (Sun Feb 11th 2018):

[*] Updated PHPMailer to use latest code (5.2.5+) from the 5.2-stable

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.7.0 (Thu Nov 16th 2017):

[+] Added ability to authenticate with either username or email address,
 if the authentication scheme supports it.

 setting problems to the error mechanism rather than the browser.
[*] Improved localisation, especially for French, colons are no longer
 hard-coded in HTML and instead populated by CSS.
[*] Removed the supplementary information in the 'fulldescription' text
 string. It didn't help and indeed was misleading as things like the
 type have their own form field.
[-] Stripped out HTML tags and entities from validation messages. See SF
 Bugs #380.
[*] Added a warning symbol on the edit_entry page instead of a green
 tick when an admin makes a booking that would normally violate one
 or more of the policy rules. See SF Support Requests 1171.
[*] Updated Portuguese translation. Thanks to Paulo Resende.
[*] Added even more options for configuring PHPMailer TLS settings.
[*] Set PHP's default charset.
[*] Changed the way that period names are defined so that they can now
 contain special chars and are put through htmlspecialchars() before
 being output to the browser. (Previously the site administrator had
 to encode special chars).
[-] Fixed a bug with the display of entries starting at 0000 in the
 month view. See SF Support Requests #1186.

 security measure. See SF Feature Requests #351.
[-] Changed access level for check_slot_ajax to match edit_entry.
[*] Made the default access level 1 for the report, search and
 view_entry pages to prevent usernames being revealed. See SF Feature
 Requests #351.

 can handle long lines.
[*] Restricted more form handlers to only accept POSTs.
[*] Improved word breaking slightly on webkit browsers. See SF Support
 Requests #951 and #1200.
[-] Fixed bug causing a booking occupying a single slot at the end of
 the day not to show in the day and week views. See SF Support Requests 1207.
[*] Made the DB connection DSN more strictly correct, and also support
 setting $db_host to "" (or unset), to indicate you'd like
 MRBS to use the default Unix domain socket instead of TCP. See
 [bugs:#384]. On Linux at least, this works for both MySQL and
 PostgreSQL.
[-] Fixed database transaction problems. See SF Support Requests #977.
[*] Altered transaction methods to use PDO transaction methods.
[*] Updated Spanish language file. Thanks to JLMartin.
[+] Added the ability to have different period names in each area. See
 SF Support Requests 1214.

 it. Added function and triggers for updating the timestamp columns when
 using PostgreSQL.
[*] Added sorting by the real date on the timestamp column in the users
 table.
[-] Fixed a problem with buttons not appearing if the user is logged in
 with a username in a different case to the creator of the booking.
[+] Added a Romanian language translation, thanks to Mihai Andreana.
 See SF Support requests 1285.
[-] Fixed problem with validation of multiple email addresses - see SF
 Support Requests #1290.
[*] Added some error handling in the event of an invalid user id in
 edit_users.php.
[-] Fixed bug in password rehashing (auth_db).
[+] Add SAML auth and session schemes, thanks to Jørn Åne.
[*] Updated to jQuery 3.2.1 and jQueryUI 1.12.1, which includes XSS fixes.
[*] Added more error reporting to mutex_lock() [DB classes].
[-] Fixed a number of security issues in MRBS that were disclosed to
 the project by SySS GmbH, including XSS, CSRF protection and session
 fixation.
 [SYSS-2017-021, SYSS-2017-022, SYSS-2017-023, SYSS-2017-024]
[*] Improved error reporting around database mutexes.
[*] All forms now only accept POST submission.
[*] Implemented a new set of Form classes, though not all sections of
 MRBS are using them yet.
[*] Added CSRF protection throughout MRBS.
[*] Added a new config setting, $auth['allow_custom_html'], to determine whether
 custom HTML is allowed in rooms/areas. This defaults to off, so if you
 are using this feature and upgrade to 1.6.2 you will need to set
 the variable to true in your config.inc.php.
[*] Dropped support for Internet Explorer 9 and lower.
[-] Implemented a fix for when "All day" is checked and the area "eveningends"
 is past midnight. See SF Patches #62.

[-] Fixed bug in reports: the case sensitivity of types was not being
 recognised (see SF Support Requests #776)
[-] Fixed problem with day links in the wek view. See SF bugs #339
[-] Fixed bug that caused MRBS to miss conflicts with single entries
 when modifying a series. See SF Bugs #338.

 properly if an existing series is being modified and there is at
 least one single entry in the same interval.
[-] Fixed bug whereby the conflict checker wasn't firing when the repeat
 end date changed
[*] Changed MRBS default behaviour to be *not* to use persistent
 database connections, as they can cause problems with transactions
 and locks. At the same time changed the config variable to be
 $db_persist instead of $db_nopersist.
[*] Added sha256 authentication support for db_ext auth scheme. [Markus Gilli]
[*] Added ablility to read user access level from external database to
 db_ext auth scheme.[Markus Gilli]
[-] Fixed bug in CSV reports when running on Windows (see SF Support
 Requests 860)
[-] Fixed bug causing a booking to be made even if the specified repeat
 results in no bookings (eg a weekly repeat for Thursdays starting
 and ending on the same day, which isn't a Thursday)
[*] Changed the behaviour of MRBS when making a repeat booking that
 results in just a single entry (for example a daily repeat starting
 and ending on the same day). Previously this was treated as a
 special case and converted into a single entry. However it seems
 more logical to treat it as a series with just one entry. This
 enables the repeat characteristics to be edited in the future.
[+] Allowed the type field to be mandatory (see SF Support Requests 876)
[-] Fixed problem whereby the locale could not be set when automatic
 language changing was disabled and no override locale was set. See

[+] Added a sort key for the area table.
[*] Changed the default character encoding for CSV files as the latest
 versions of Excel now seem to recognise UTF-8 automatically.

 database during a database upgrade. If the site admin wants errors to
 go to the browser, eg for debugging, then they should.
[-] Fixed datalists so that empty strings aren't presented as options
[*] Added a datalist input to report inputs when the standard fields
 have select_options or datalist_options defined. See SF Support
 Requests #909

 type options are not shown.
[-] Fixed problem with Chrome not showing datalist options (see SF bugs
 #360).
[+] Added config options to allow users (or just admins) to specify that
 an email shouldn't be sent when making a booking. Useful if you are
 just making a minor change or are creating a whole lot of bookings
 at the beginning of a term or season. See SF Support requests #974.
[-] Fixed problem with the endtime selector not having a selected value
 in the very rare case that the area's morningstarts or resolution is
 changed in between refreshes of the browser on the edit_entry page.
 See also SF Support Requests #983.
[-] Fixed problem with Bulk Delete on the report page. See SF Bugs #361.
[-] Fixed problem with Schedule and Policy tabs not appearing. See SF

 Requests #1078. Also fixed another bug at the same time - there was
 no border around bookings in the month view on printing.
[*] Changed the behaviour of the printed month view, getting rid of
 horizontal and vertical scrollbars. Instead, horizontal overflow is
 hidden and the table cell expands to accommodate vertical overflow.

 using the 'both' option for monthly listings and (b) listings
 wrapping when using 'slot' or 'description'.
[-] Fixed bug causing fatal error when trying to delete a series.

[*] Made sure that the default duration for new bookings doesn't exceed
 the maximum duration
[*] Added a new option to disable "Opportunistic TLS" in PHPMailer.
[-] Fixed bug causing bookings to be shown as private when they weren't.
[-] Fixed bug that allowed the type colour to be shown even when the
 type was private. See SF bugs #372.

[*] Added rollback of outstanding transactions to the shutdown function
 in an attempt to prevent duplicate bookings when using persistent
 database connections. See SF bugs #314

 in the future. You can set limits globally as well per area,
 enabling you to set policies of the sort "Max 2 bookings per week
 in this area and max 5 bookings per week across the system". Note
 also that setting 0 bookings per period for an area is a way of
 stopping ordinary users from making bookings in a particular

 on some systems.
[+] Added Portuguese Brazilian translation - thanks to Gleise S. O.

 will happen on sites that do not have external internet access,
 the last_updated field is updated anyway so that MRBS does not
 attempt to retry for another 28 days.
[*] Kept track of how many Ajax requests are outstanding on the
 server so that we don't swamp the server with requests if for
 some reason the server is taking a long time to process them.

 a $ character followed by a number.
[*] Allowed entries to be deleted even if they are longer than the
 max_duration or beyond the max_book_ahead date. Following
 suggestion from Marco Tedaldi.
[*] Made the week numbers and months in the mini calendars into
 links, following a suggestion by Marco Tedaldi.
[-] iCalendar notifications expanded to allow more applications to

 addresses on the "Cc" line.
[*] Improved the message in email notifications for a list of deleted
 repeat bookings
[*] Removed the privacy radio buttons from the Report form when the
 user is not logged in as they're then redundant because only the
 "user" will only be able to see public bookings. Thanks to a
 suggestion from Jörg Wiemann in SF Tracker ID: 3405402
[*] Added an Ajax capability to the edit_entry form so that a booking
 is checked for scheduling and policy conflicts as the booking
 parameters are changed.
[-] Fixed bug causing disabled rooms to be displayed incorrectly in
 view_entry.php
[*] Converted language FAQs to UTF-8.
[*] Added a timer so that a potential booking on the edit_entry form
 can be periodically rechecked for validity, in case someone else
 makes or releases a booking while the page is open. Can be
 disabled and the interval set by means of a config variable.
[*] Revamped the LDAP authentication scheme somewhat. You can now
 specify most of the configuration parameters as arrays, so that
 you can have multiple servers or multiple base DNs that are
 configured in different ways.

 Additionally, you can now determine whether a user is an
 administrator by defining LDAP configuration parameters:
 $ldap_group_member_attrib and $ldap_admin_group_dn. See
 systemdefaults.inc.php for details.
[-] Set PostgreSQL client encoding to UTF8. Thanks to Andreas Lange
 for the patch (SF ID 3413080)
[*] Added a Back button to the Add/Edit users form.
[*] Changed the report from method from "get" to "post" to make it
 possible to accommodate complicated search criteria, especially
 with many custom fields
[+] Added the ability to run report.php from the command line (useful
 for example for setting up reports as cron jobs). Provided a
 manual page at help_report.html. The ability to run from the
 command line is disabled by default in systemdefaults.inc.php and
 has to be deliberately enabled.
[*] Added a tabbed dialog that can be displayed to give more details
 of schedule and policy checks on the edit_entry page. This has
 the advantage that it contains clickable links to conflicting
 bookings, which the tooltips cannot.
[*] Added a sanity check to check that 'private_override' is one of
 the three valid values in case the database has somehow got
 messed up.
[*] Stopped ordinary users seeing the disabled/enabled status of a
 room.
[+] The
 report results, search results, users list, rooms list and
 pending list are now sortable, searchable tables. In addition
 admins can do bulk deletes of the entries returned in a report.
[*] Added Russian translation supplied by Capitan Nemo.
[*] Improved the performance of the day/week/month views, especially
 the day view in IE with large tables (many rooms and many
 periods/time slots).
[*] Updated installation instructions for a PostgreSQL database to
 create a database with UTF8 encoding. See SF ID: 3413080.
[*] Updated German translation, thanks to Jörg Wiemann.
[*] Changed alt text on logo. Thanks to dwpoon. See SF ID 3420435.
[+] MRBS now supports
 (except for IE8 and below) (a) the selection of new bookings by
 dragging over empty cells on the day and week views and (b) the
 adjustment of existing bookings by dragging their sides or
 corners.
[-] Correctly encode subject in delete notification mails.
[-] Changed ical output so that some email clients no longer get
 booking automatically imported into their calendar, without any
 user action.
[-] Fixed bug whereby $auth['only_admin_can_book'] didn't work as required
 if $auth['deny_public_access'] was set.
[*] Got rid of the $mail_charset config variable. All emails now sent
 as UTF-8.
[*] Restricted the requirement for the iconv module to those cases
 when it is really needed, ie when the server is running AIX or
 Windows.
[-] Fixed, or at least ameliorated, a problem that can occur on
 Windows servers where the dates can randomly change language, due
 to other scripts running in a different thread in the same
 process calling setlocale().
[*] Removed the code that had to exist in config.inc.php in a
 particular place. Booking entry types are now configured by the
 simple array $booking_types, which contains elements like "E" and
 "I". The entry types are now localised in the translation files
 as "type.X" where X is the booking type. config.inc.php no longer
 needs to include language.inc, and the $typel configuration array
 has been removed.
[-] Removed a number of undefined variables warnings.
[-] Fixed a problem whereby "foreign" characters in CSV reports
 opened by Microsoft Excel did not display properly. This is
 actually an Excel problem, rather than an MRBS problem, but there
 is now a circumvention in MRBS.
[*] Restricted the options available in the end time selector to
 those permitted if a maximum duration has been specified.
[*] Updated French translation.
[*] Ensured that if a new booking is selected and the default
 duration takes the booking past the end of the booking day, then
 the default end time is the end of the booking day (rather than
 the start time + resolution, as at present).
[-] Escaped some Javascript strings.
[+] Added option to auth_ldap to disable client referrals. Provided
 by Daniel Yule.
[+] Made $timezone a per-area setting. Based on input from Chris
 Thompson.
[*] Ensured that the “all day” check box only appears if the maximum
 booking duration allows that length of booking. Based on a patch
 from Daniel Yule.
[*] Added the ability to display the mini calendars at the bottom, if
 $display_calendars_bottom is set to true. Based on a patch from
 Daniel Yule.
[+] Added support for displaying the week number in the month view if
 $view_week_number is set.
[-] Fixed two bugs: (1) Undefined index error if a mandatory field is
 defined in the config file but doesn't exist in the database (2)
 MRBS not picking up mandatory integer fields when JavaScript is
 disabled.
[*] Limited the timezones presented in the timezone drop-down box on
 the Edit Area page to those that have a corresponding VTIMEZONE
 definition.

[*] Clarified documentation in auth_ext.php a little.
[*] Added some email debug information to help diagnose problems when
 sending emails.
[*] Extracted the per-area default settings from systemdefaults and
 put them into a new file, areadefaults.inc.php, to make it more
 obvious that these are the default settings for new areas and
 will have no effect on existing areas.
[*] Added lang.en as the fall-back language, in order that something
 is shown even when the $default_language_tokens file does not
 have a translated token. Based on a patch by Thomas Bleher.
[+] Added an option to report.php to summarize by type. Thamks to a
 patch submitted by Thomas Bleher.

 some languages (eg German). See SF tracker #3313655.
[+] On the Report page, converted input fields into auto-complete
 fields for custom fields that have select_options defined - For
 custom fields allowed $select_options to be an associative array,
 thus making it easy to change the displayed value without having
 to change the database. (See SF #3315966)
[+] Implemented an optional limit on the maximum length of a booking
 for non-admins. At the moment it is a global limit rather than
 per-area. It also does not yet prevent invalid booking lengths
 being shown in the edit_entry form.
[*] Tweaked iCalendar email data. (See also SF Tracker id 3297799)
[+] Added two new auth methods, 'crypt' and 'auth_basic'.
[-] A fix for use an uninitialised array in

 when using periods. [SF Support Request #3161926]
[*] Removed MRBS's non-Unicode mode. All installations will now run
 in Unicode, with all pages served as UTF-8 and all data in the database
 as UTF-8. If you upgrade an installation running in non-Unicode mode
 you must run the improved convert_db_to_utf8.php script, as detailed
 in UPGRADE.
[*] Updated/fixed Czech translation from Marek Grác.
[-] Fixed problem where start and end times do not appear correctly
 in the select boxes on the edit_entry form when using 12 hour

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.3 (Tue Nov 24 22:00:00 GMT 2009):

 client charset if $unicode_encoding is true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.2 (Thu July 15 00:00 BST 2009):

[+] Added checking of lengths of values for user-typeable fields, so that

 which causes errors with PostgreSQL. Adds new array variable $maxlength
 to config.inc.php that _must_ be populated if you are upgrading and keeping
 your old config.inc.php.

 format before an SQL call, thereby creating an error. First report of
 the problem was  SF tracker #1794351.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 used.
[+] Added the ability to hide certain days of the week.

[+] Added Hungarian internationalision, in preparation for an offered
 translation.
[-] Removed all HTML entities apart from &nbsp; from the translations,
 so that the flawed PHP function html_entity_decode() doesn't need
 to be used in the email sending code - solving a problem when running
 MRBS with PHP 4.
[*] Booking highlighting is now performed with CSS rather than JavaScript
 by default, except in IE6, which doesn't support the appropriate
 CSS feature. This improves performance in IE7/8, and makes the highlighting
 not depend on JavaScript, which is good.

 came from, be in day, week or month.
[*] Improved highlighting of booking links in month view.

 from 07:00 to 19:300, with the last slot being 18:30->19:00.
[*] Fixed a bug that made all-day bookings not reserve the last slot in
 the day.
[*] Help, report and search pages now show the logon box in the header.
[-] Fixed HTML escaping of period descriptions, period descriptions must
 be valid HTML in config.inc.php.

      and the user's password isn't stored in the session data any more.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2-pre3 (Fri May 14 04:00:00 GMT 2004):

[+] Added long awaited "periods" support. Calendar can displays 'periods'
      instead of classic time of the day.
[+] New authentication scheme 'auth_db'. This is a web-based authentication,
      based on a user table in the mrbs database. User administration page has
      a special feature to automatically display fields that admin may add to
      the user table, no need to edit the code. This new authentication is not
      yet implemented for Postgresql.
      PLEASE READ RELEVANT SECTION IN "AUTHENTICATION" BEFORE THE FIRST USE.
[+] Added email support. Emails can be sent to MRBS administrator, area or
      room administrators, or bookers and for each entry creation, change or
      deletion. Emails for changed entries display the value of previous
      settings. Added emails fields to room/area admin and edit_users pages.
[+] Added option to retrieve users emails from other authentication
      schemes as auth_db (if ldap is used, user email will be username plus
      domain name)
[+] Added option to allow for a day to start at say 8:30 am.
[+] Database tables names are now variables defined in config.inc.php. This
will allow users to install multiple sets of mrbs tables when only one
SQL database is available, or resolve table name conflicts.
[+] Booking is now possible from the month view by clicking a new 'plus sign',
      taking the user to an add entry page for that day of the month.
[+] Using auth_db, the link "you are XXXX" becomes a link to all upcoming
      entries belonging to XXXX (report page).
[+] Added support for multiple pop3 or imap server to be used for
      authentication (in case of failure).
[+] Added greek language (Stavros Papadakis), updated finish (Tom Ingberg),
      german (Michael Glaessel) and swedish (MissterX) languages.
[+] Added option to determine the default starting view, i.e. month, week or
      day (Warren Turkal) and the starting room.
[+] Added support for changing area/room in Add/Edit entry form.
[*] Capacity is not displayed in brackets next to room name if capacity is 0
[*] Preview page now displays the color key.
[*] Added option to display both time and descriptions in month view.
[*] Various enhancements to display/navigation (added pop-up messages in
      various places, added direct links between room headings and week
      view, highlighting of cells on mouse-over, highlighting of current
      month/week/day in mini calendars, ability to book a room by clicking
      anywhere in cells, navigation link duplicated under the calendar...)
[*] Added option to display time on right side in day and week view
[*] Enhancements to report page: added 'type', 'creator' and various sorting
      options.
[*] LDAP servers login processes, does an anonymous bind first
[*] Fixed bug/enhancements to avoid url problems when using a proxy in
      the environment. Although breaking HTTP specs, use of relative paths
      allows to run mrbs with https (ssl).
[*] Added some javascript code to control user inputs mainly in edit_entry.php
      (avoid selecting february 30,...)

and several other minor bug fixes and minor changes. To see details, please
read /web/Changelog file from Dec 07 2003.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2-pre2 (Sun Dec 07 00:00:00 GMT 2003):

[+] Completely revamped authentication logic.
    Now MRBS make use of sessions to store temporary user data,
    ability to log on/off, and so on... This is now the default mode.
    See AUTHENTICATION for more details.
[+] Revamped localisation.
      Automatic language determination made much better, works for
	  Windows and Unix servers now
[+] Added utility to convert text in the database to UTF8.
[+] Revamped internationalisation. MRBS can now be called  fulled Unicode.
      MRBS serves all of it's pages in UTF-8 and stores everything in the
      database in UTF-8. This means that all languages work together.
[+] Bubbles are displayed when mouse hover entries in day, week and month
      view, showing a more complete description.
[+] Allow to view weeks in the bottom of the web pages as week numbers
      instead of 'first day of the week' (Per Wermelin - SKIOLD Sæby A/S"
	  <ela@skiold.dk>).
[*] Added a new script for the "ext" authentication scheme that
	  allows you to use a password file with usernames and their
	  crypted passwords.

[-] Fixed bug: when you press on print preview
      in report.php page, all but the submission form is visible but
      not the actual report  (sQuare).
[*] In the minicalendar week view, the full week is highlighted instead of
      the first day of the week (sQuare).
[-] Bug fix: in week view, allow non 'internet explorer' browsers to see links
      to the corresponding days in column titles (Johan.Schonning).
[+] Entries in monthly view can be shown as start/end slot or brief description
[*] Replaced the column titles in the week view to  be links to the
	  corresponding days (sQuare).

        formats to be changed to 12 hour format.
[*] Updated all language files to be consistent
[*] Changed minicals so they point to week when on week view and month on
        month view, rather than always pointing at day view
[*] Changed occurrences of "<?=" to "<?php echo" which means we still
        use the long tag form everywhere.
[*] Removed all remainings english strings to make MRBS 100% translatable
        * Added new $vocab to del.php, edit_area_room.php, edit_entry.php,
          edit_entry_handler.php, help.php, mysql.inc, pgsql.inc,
          view_entry.php, functions.inc
[+] Modified config.inc language section to choose a site_faq.html file
        translated in another language.
        * Modified help.php to take these changes into account.
        * Added site_faq_fr.html (french)
[+] Added auth_name.inc, a auth_ip.inc variant using DNS name instead of ip.
[+] Added auth_omni.inc for use with OmniHTTPd web server security features
[-] Change search.php to remove warnings introduced with PHP 4.3.0
[-] Change trailer.inc to make print preview more likely to work on
        windows and non-apache servers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1-pre2 (Thu Jan  9 17:50:00 GMT 2003)

[+] New POP3 authentication scheme (Daniel Gardner)
[*] Updated Spanish translation
[-] Fix for edit entry page. We now determine the area id
        of the room the meeting we're editting is in before
        getting a list of the rooms in that area. This solves
        a number of errors that occur when editting/creating
        bookings.
[-] Fixes submitted/suggested by Jean-François Larvoire:
        * Added closing ?> to index.php
        * Added "global $refresh_rate;" to style.inc
        * Fixed all occurrences (hopefully) of $vocab[] indices
          written without surrounding quotes.
[*] Changed all uses of <? to <?php.
[+] Merged change from John Beranek for an Advanced search function,
        requires 3 more translation tokens, which have been added to
        each language file, "search_button" should be OK, as I took
        the text from each language's "search" token.
[-] Fixed 2 problems in edit_entry.php as submitted on the mailing list.
[*] Added small enhancement to smb_auth.c, if you pass a username
        as group/user, it will change the NT group that is used for
        authentication.
[*] Improved shell escaping in auth_ext.inc. It now uses
        escapeshellarg() instead of escapeshellcmd(). If your PHP
        version is less than 4.0.3, then it includes escapeshellarg.inc
        which is a local implementation of that function.
[*] Added updated French translation, as provided by Thierry Wehr.
[*] Tided all language files again, they all have the same format
        and number of lines now, and are all missing at least 2 translations
        because of the new advanced search functionality.
[-] Fixed a number of bugs to make the Taiwanese translation work.
        The code to include language files based on HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
        has been improved, which ensures lang.zh-tw is included.
        Additionally, mincals.inc not longer does a substr() on the
        abbreviated weekday names, as this breaks terribly for any
        multibyte encoding, as it was only taking the first byte
        of a multibyte encoding. This has the impact that you now
        get Mon,Tue,Wed etc instead of M,T,W (using glibc's en_GB
        locale).
[-] print_header() now outputs a DOCTYPE identifier as well as
        sending Pragma no-cache and an Expires header in the
        past. This should help ensure the web pages don't get cached.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1-pre1 (Thu May 30 12:41:02 BST 2002)

[*] add config option for drop-down boxes to select area and room
          (Thanks to sponsorship of LTC Corporation)

[+] add translation:     Czech, SmEjDiL

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 (Thu Aug 30 22:26:54 BST 2001)

[+] Added two upgrade.xx.sql files which should have been in -pre2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0-pre2 (Sun Jul  8 13:43:53 BST 2001)

[*] Incorporated diff from Scott Leonard that allows you to configure a refresh
        time for roombooker web pages.  Set config variable $refresh_rate to the
        number of seconds to refresh after, or set to 0 to disable.
[+] Implemented "n-weekly" repeat type. Not sure I like the way it's phrased in
        the lang files, but the code works fine.  You can now have a meeting
        that is repeated every 'n' weeks. e.g. every 5th Monday.  This required
        a database change, which I've made available in upgrade2.my.sql and
        upgrade2.pg.sql
[*] Tidied lang files, and ensured every file has all the required tokens.
        'wc -l lang.*' now shows all the files as having the same line count.
        Quite a few languages now have English bits in them though.
[*] Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that allow you to configure a filter
        for LDAP authentication.
[-] Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that solve problems with bookings made
        for times that have smaller granularity that the configured booking
        resolution.
[-] Fixed config.inc so that the correct lang.xx is included if
        HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is a comma-seperated list like "sv, en".
[*] Copied "rep_type_5" language token into Swedish and Spanish language
        files from English file.  Swedish and Spanish users were not able
        to use "monthly, corresponding day" repeats without the token being
        present.
[*] Checked in updates to lang.es (received from Pablo Gomez) and lang.de
        (received by Bernd Oeggl).
[*] Update lang.nl file (marc ter horst)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0-pre1 (Sun Mar  4 23:26:43 GMT 2001)

[*] Internationalised functions.inc. "Help", "Admin" and "Search:" are now lang
        strings. Also, fixed an error in lang.fr, $vocab["mrbs"] was defined
        twice. (jberanek)
[*] Added double quotes around all uses of color and class attributes, as HTML
        dictates. (jberanek)
[*] On conflict, show start time and link to day/week/month views (redinger)
[+] Link each search result start time to entry's day view (bernd, beranak)

    Branch Merge (2001-02-24 ljb):

        New tables.pg.sql to build tables for PostgreSQL.
        New destroy.pg.sql to delete PostgreSQL tables and sequences.
        New grant.pg.sql - edit this and run to grant PostgreSQL rights.
        Replaced connect.inc with mysql.inc and pgsql.inc.
        New variable in config.inc "$dbsys" selects "mysql" or "pgsql".
        Renamed variables in config.inc to replace "mysql_" prefix with "db_".
        New wrapper functions (see README.sqlapi) to encapsulate database calls.
        New pgsql.inc provides PostgreSQL implementation, and connects.
        New mysql.inc provides MySQL implementation, and connects.
        Rewrote all database calls to use wrapper functions.
        Rewrote all SQL statements to be standards-compliant, where possible.
            Used new wrapper routines where non-standard SQL is needed.
            Replace LEFT JOIN sequence with predicate-based joins.
        Changes to all error handling to ensure errors are properly reported.
[+] New week.php for Week View. (Experimental)
[+] New month.php for Month View. (Experimental)
[*] Added rows of links in trailer.inc to new month and week views.
[*] Changed Entry Type from 2 values (I=Internal, E=External) to 10 values.
        By default only the same 2 are defined in config.inc.
        Style sheet contains colors for 10 types.
        Selection box for type in edit/add entry form is dynamically built.
        Color key in day view dynamically built from defined types.
        Color key in day view moved to bottom of page.
[+] New Report function, linked from new button in the header. This makes
        a report on entries selected by date range and match strings.
[*] Add config.inc option db_nopersist to not use persistent DB connections.
[-] Add missing args to print_header call in del.php.
[+] Add config option eveningends_minutes to allow full 24 hour display with
        more resolution than 1 hour; also allows better control over the
        displayed hours, for example the last slot can now be 16:30-17:00.
[*] Removed unused functions from functions.inc: get_sunday_before()
        print_date_entries() display_unapproved_events() display_time()
        mysql_date_to_str() get_webrowser() hextoint() decode_str() encode_str()
        Also removed load_user_preferences code and calls to it.
[*] Remove redundant includes: functions.inc now assumes config.inc was
        included and does not include it again; search.php and view_entry.php do
        not need authentication so they don't need to include mrbs_auth.inc.
        Removed redundant connect to datbase in search.php.
[*] New error function fatal_error() to ensure errors are in a proper HTML page.
[+] Added new repeat type 5: monthly repeat, corresponding weekday and week.
[+] New authentication for Netware: auth_nw.inc (see README.nwauth). This is
        needed because nwauth takes the password on stdin, not cmdline.
[*] Used weblint to validate output pages and corrected HTML where needed.
        Quote all attribute values, fix bad attributes, balance tags.
[*] Moved HTML end tags into trailer.inc.
[*] Changed trailer to put " | " between dates, instead of ", " after each.
[-] In print_header, fix bad position of style.inc; must be in <HEAD> block.
[-] Fix syntax error when adding room if no capacity given (use 0).
[*] Change day.php to output equal-width room columns with centered headers.
[*] search.php: Use COUNT(*) and no ORDER BY when just getting match count.
[*] Fixed typo in view_entry.php on building up per-day repeat option string.
[-] Redesign loop for adding repeat dates to prevent it from scheduling 1 past
        the end date if the end date wasn't a date to schedule.
[*] Add "about" section to help.php to display viersion, system, database.
[-] Patch from BoK: fix "2 Decembers displayed if you pick "31 Nov" and Go.
        This makes sure the selected date is a valid date.
[-] Patch from robc: Fix to prevent edit entry to make it overlap another.
[+] New feature from Bo: Edit area and room names (new edit_area_room.php).
[*] Sort (order) the room names alphabetically in the main display (day.php).
    Changes found in CVS source:
[*] Changed "Booker's Name" to "Brief Description" (was in post-0.9pre1 CVS)
[*] View_entry uses multi-table query to show room description too (was in CVS)
[*] If no area is supplied, don't use 1 (or 0) since there might not be such
        an area (if it was deleted). Instead, use new get_default_area() which
        gets the lowest-numbered area.  In print_header(), don't pass along
        area as a hidden parameter if it wasn't supplied in the first place.
[*] Patch from BoK: Booking repeat Sat/Sun, only entered first Sun.
[*] Fixes to PHP magic quoting. We now turn of magic_quotes_runtime always,
        and use new slashes() and unslashes() to conditionally deal with
        backslack-quotes depending on value of PHP's magic_quotes_gpc setting.
        NOTE: Possibly slightly incompatible change. Prior versions may have
        put pre-quoted values (area name, room name, booking name, booking
        description) into the database tables. This was wrong. If so, you
        will see funny \'s in the value displays.
        MRBS now should properly quote and unquote all values behind the scenes.
[*] Admin.php gets the area name from the database if it only has the ID.
[-] Patch from BoK: fix duplicate bookings from failure to delete caused by
        bad entry_type change to 2.
[*] Updates to site_faq.html - describe repeats, generalize Authentication info.
[*] Use a mutual exclusion lock (mutex) when adding an entry to prevent races.
[+] New maintenance SQL scripts: purge.my.sql and purge.pg.sql to delete old
        entries from your database (default 30 days old).
[*] Fixed field alignment in Add/Edit Entry form to right-justify labels.
[*] Security: Use EscapeShellCmd() on username and password in auth_ext.inc
[-] Fixed function toTimeString() to use lang[] for time units (I18N).
[*] Streamlined main query in day.php: omit unused columns, improve predicate
        to select by times from 6 compares to 2.
[*] In day.php, only fill in map entries during the day hours of interest.
[*] In lang.* language files, fixed quoting (found in CVS), comments, strip
        CRs and fixed some typos.
[-] Use double quotes around all string array indexes except inside strings.
        This avoids a PHP notice-level warning on each array reference.
[-] Fix undefined variable references to avoid notice-level PHP warnings.
[-] Bug fix: round meeting times up to $resolution units, not 30 minutes, and
        don't allow 0 minute meetings - make them 1 resolution unit instead.
[*] When using the footer to change dates, remember the current area.
[-] Changed view_entry to always show both time and date for start and end time;
        the CVS version was buggy and quirky in suppressing the date or time if
        it thought they were not important. Better to show too much info.
[+] New weekstarts and dateformat (Jan 01 vs 01 Jan) config (from BoK),
        generalized to show the week starting on any day.
[*] Add inline colors for non-CSS browsers (based on patch from John Beranek).
[*] Added current date header above day display (from John Beranek).
