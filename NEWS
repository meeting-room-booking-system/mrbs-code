[============================]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.9 (Wed Oct 03 22:00:00 BST 2012):

[-] Fixed bug that caused the '+' button for a booking to not work correctly.
[+] Added Hebrew support, as contributed by Michal Kastro.
[+] Added Thai language support, as contributed by Suthep.
[*] Improved language detection code.
[-] Fixed JavaScript error produced if you have a mandatory textarea
 field. Thanks to Neil Brown. See SF ID 3472380
[*] Changed "max_book_ahead" to stop people getting around the restriction
 with long bookings.
[-] Fixed a number of user interaction problems.
[-] Fixed auth_ldap configuration variable handling, thanks to Kevan
 Carstensen.
[-] DataTables AJAX requests now use relative URLs in order to stop
 cross-domain requests.
[+] Added ability to import iCalendar (.ics) files.
[*] Updated Turkish translation from Ahmet YILDIZ.
[*] Updated German translation - thanks to JWiemann.
[+] Introduced the $vocab_override config variable, allowing MRBS
 text strings to be customised without editing the lang files.
 Thanks to dwpoon.
[-] Improved SQL escaping so that it uses the database escaping
 routines and not PHP's addslashes() function. Thanks to
 Henry S. Thompson.
[-] Fixed bug which meant that the correct timezone wasn't
 necessarily being used when dragging a booking.
[-] Fixed performance issue when using LDAP authentication and HTTP
 sessions. Thanks to dwpoon.
[-] Fixed bug causing an entry of '0' in a mandatory custom field to
 be rejected.
[*] Changed font colour for row and column labels in the calendar
 view when printing to make them show up better in Google Chrome
[*] Improved CSV output, including removal of the requirement
 of having PHP's 'iconv' extension.
[-] Fixed infinite loop in setting the time zone when
 $timezone configuratation variable wasn't set.
[+] Added support for setting limits on the maximum number of
 bookings that can be made per day, week, month, year and for any time
 in the future. You can set limits globally as well per area,
 enabling you to set policies of the sort "Max 2 bookings per week
 in this area and max 5 bookings per week across the system". Note
 also that setting 0 bookings per period for an area is a way of
 stopping ordinary users from making bookings in a particular
 area.
[-] Fixed bug that caused the ticks and crosses on the edit_entry
 page not to appear properly in some browsers (eg Chrome and IE8)
 on some systems.
[+] Added Portuguese Brazilian translation - thanks to Gleise S. O.
 Teixeira
[+] Added Hungarian translation. Thanks to Gergely Kiss.
[*] Made use of HTML5 form element attributes (eg "required") so that
 client-side form validation can be done by the browser where
 possible, instead of by JavaScript.
[*] Tidied the MRBS distribution, so that different types of files
 live in different directories.
[*] Updated Norwegian translation. Thanks to Thomas Haukland.
[+] Added an array of substitute languages, for example to substitute
 'no' for 'nb-NO'.
[-] Fixed bug causing resizable bookings not to work properly when
 using periods.
[*] Added a couple of extra headers to expires_header() to encourage
 caching.
[*] Simplified presentation of output options on report form.
[*] Improved reports.
[-] Fixed bug preventing resizable bookings from working when there's
 only one time slot or period in the day.
[*] Added an HTTP header to prevent IE going into Compatibility View.
[+] Added a new config setting, $max_booking_date, to prevent
 bookings after a certain date, eg the end of term. Thanks to a
 suggestion by Matthew Hilling.
[*] Made the users table use an Ajax data source for better
 performance with large numbers of users
[-] Fixed bug on pending page where only a maximum of 10 members of a
 series were being displayed
[*] Added some positive visual feedback when bookings are altered by
 dragging the cell border.
[-] Fixed bug giving incorrect previous repeat end date in email
 notification when a booking is changed from an individual booking
 to a series.
[*] Upgraded jQuery and jQuery UI.
[-] Fixed some issues in the some of the upgrade steps.
[*] Updated Japanese translation. Thanks to Takanori Matsuura.
[*] Updated Czech translation. Thanks to Ondřej Kopka.
[*] Implemented page refresh in the day and week views using Ajax
 requests if possible instead of through a <meta> tag.
[*] Improved Javascript code correctness.
[-] Improved error handling when updating VTIMEZONE definitions. Now
 if MRBS is unable to download a new definition from the web, as
 will happen on sites that do not have external internet access,
 the last_updated field is updated anyway so that MRBS does not
 attempt to retry for another 28 days.
[*] Kept track of how many Ajax requests are outstanding on the
 server so that we don't swamp the server with requests if for
 some reason the server is taking a long time to process them.
[-] Made utf8_bytecount() PHP4-safe.
[-] Fixed problem with users being unable to login when MRBS is
 running on IIS
[-] Fixed sorting and styling of integer custom fields in
 edit_users.php
[-] Fixed a bug in 'db' and 'db_ext' authentication schemes when
 using MySQL whereby a login was validated successfully even if
 the username contained trailing spaces. This then caused problems
 subsequently when comparing the creator of a booking with the
 user. See SF Bugs #245.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.8 (Sun Jan 01 22:00:00 GMT 2012):

[-] Fixed bug that meant that '0' was treated as an invalid search
 string.
[-] Fixed auth_ext authentication for users or passwords that contain
 a $ character followed by a number.
[*] Allowed entries to be deleted even if they are longer than the
 max_duration or beyond the max_book_ahead date. Following
 suggestion from Marco Tedaldi.
[*] Made the week numbers and months in the mini calendars into
 links, following a suggestion by Marco Tedaldi.
[-] iCalendar notifications expanded to allow more applications to 
 understand times/time zone information. See SF tracker 3324122.
[*] Added database error checking and handling to sql_*_field_info().
[-] Corrected a minor error in edit_entry Javascript, thanks to Guenter
 Boehm.
[*] Improved SQL error reporting.
[*] Made the date range for the date selectors a config variable.
[*] Added an option on the booking form to skip past conflicting
 bookings when making repeat bookings.
[+] Added a "Skip and book" button to the page listing conflicting
 entries if you try and make a repeat booking where some of the
 entries have conflicts.
[*] Upgraded jQuery UI from version 1.8.11 to 1.8.16.
[+] Added a config setting to disable email sending, overriding any
 other settings. Useful for testing MRBS without having to worry
 about sending mail to people not expecting it.
[*] Added a Back button to the edit_entry page.
[*] Added a list of dates of repeat bookings to email notifications.
[-] Fixed bug whereby email notifications would not be sent if MRBS
 failed to find an address for those on the "To" line but there
 addresses on the "Cc" line.
[*] Improved the message in email notifications for a list of deleted
 repeat bookings
[*] Removed the privacy radio buttons from the Report form when the
 user is not logged in as they're then redundant because only the
 "user" will only be able to see public bookings. Thanks to a
 suggestion from Jörg Wiemann in SF Tracker ID: 3405402
[*] Added an Ajax capability to the edit_entry form so that a booking
 is checked for scheduling and policy conflicts as the booking
 parameters are changed.
[-] Fixed bug causing disabled rooms to be displayed incorrectly in
 view_entry.php
[*] Converted language FAQs to UTF-8.
[*] Added a timer so that a potential booking on the edit_entry form
 can be periodically rechecked for validity, in case someone else
 makes or releases a booking while the page is open. Can be
 disabled and the interval set by means of a config variable.
[*] Revamped the LDAP authentication scheme somewhat. You can now
 specify most of the configuration parameters as arrays, so that
 you can have multiple servers or multiple base DNs that are
 configured in different ways.
 
 Additionally, you can now determine whether a user is an
 administrator by defining LDAP configuration parameters:
 $ldap_group_member_attrib and $ldap_admin_group_dn. See
 systemdefaults.inc.php for details.
[-] Set PostgreSQL client encoding to UTF8. Thanks to Andreas Lange
 for the patch (SF ID 3413080)
[*] Added a Back button to the Add/Edit users form.
[*] Changed the report from method from "get" to "post" to make it
 possible to accommodate complicated search criteria, especially
 with many custom fields
[+] Added the ability to run report.php from the command line (useful
 for example for setting up reports as cron jobs). Provided a
 manual page at help_report.html. The ability to run from the
 command line is disabled by default in systemdefaults.inc.php and
 has to be deliberately enabled.
[*] Added a tabbed dialog that can be displayed to give more details
 of schedule and policy checks on the edit_entry page. This has
 the advantage that it contains clickable links to conflicting
 bookings, which the tooltips cannot.
[*] Added a sanity check to check that 'private_override' is one of
 the three valid values in case the database has somehow got
 messed up.
[*] Stopped ordinary users seeing the disabled/enabled status of a
 room.
[+] The
 report results, search results, users list, rooms list and
 pending list are now sortable, searchable tables. In addition
 admins can do bulk deletes of the entries returned in a report.
[*] Added Russian translation supplied by Capitan Nemo.
[*] Improved the performance of the day/week/month views, especially
 the day view in IE with large tables (many rooms and many
 periods/time slots).
[*] Updated installation instructions for a PostgreSQL database to
 create a database with UTF8 encoding. See SF ID: 3413080.
[*] Updated German translation, thanks to Jörg Wiemann.
[*] Changed alt text on logo. Thanks to dwpoon. See SF ID 3420435.
[+] MRBS now supports
 (except for IE8 and below) (a) the selection of new bookings by
 dragging over empty cells on the day and week views and (b) the
 adjustment of existing bookings by dragging their sides or
 corners.
[-] Correctly encode subject in delete notification mails.
[-] Changed ical output so that some email clients no longer get
 booking automatically imported into their calender, without any
 user action.
[-] Fixed bug whereby $auth['only_admin_can_book'] didn't work as required
 if $auth['deny_public_access'] was set.
[*] Got rid of the $mail_charset config variable. All emails now sent
 as UTF-8.
[*] Restricted the requirement for the iconv module to those cases
 when it is really needed, ie when the server is running AIX or
 Windows.
[-] Fixed, or at least ameliorated, a problem that can occur on
 Windows servers where the dates can randomly change language, due
 to other scripts running in a different thread in the same
 process calling setlocale().
[*] Removed the code that had to exist in config.inc.php in a
 particular place. Booking entry types are now configured by the
 simple array $booking_types, which contains elements like "E" and
 "I". The entry types are now localised in the translation files
 as "type.X" where X is the booking type. config.inc.php no longer
 needs to include language.inc, and the $typel configuration array
 has been removed.
[-] Removed a number of undefined variables warnings.
[-] Fixed a problem whereby "foreign" characters in CSV reports
 opened by Microsoft Excel did not display properly. This is
 actually an Excel problem, rather than an MRBS problem, but there
 is now a circumvention in MRBS.
[*] Restricted the options available in the end time selector to
 those permitted if a maximum duration has been specified.
[*] Updated French translation.
[*] Ensured that if a new booking is selected and the default
 duration takes the booking past the end of the booking day, then
 the default end time is the end of the booking day (rather than
 the start time + resolution, as at present).
[-] Escaped some Javascript strings.
[+] Added option to auth_ldap to disable client referrals. Provided
 by Daniel Yule.
[+] Made $timezone a per-area setting. Based on input from Chris
 Thompson.
[*] Ensured that the “all day” check box only appears if the maximum
 booking duration allows that length of booking. Based on a patch
 from Daniel Yule.
[*] Added the ability to display the mini calendars at the bottom, if
 $display_calendars_bottom is set to true. Based on a patch from
 Daniel Yule.
[+] Added support for displaying the week number in the month view if
 $view_week_number is set.
[-] Fixed two bugs: (1) Undefined index error if a mandatory field is
 defined in the config file but doesn't exist in the database (2)
 MRBS not picking up mandatory integer fields when JavaScript is
 disabled.
[*] Limited the timezones presented in the timezone drop-down box on
 the Edit Area page to those that have a corresponding VTIMEZONE
 definition.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.7 (Wed Jul 13 21:20:00 BST 2011):

 checkbox inputs.
[*] Updated Spanish translation provided by Jose Luis Martin
 Jimenez.

 delete email notifications
[*] Upgraded to jQuery 1.5.2 and jQuery UI 1.8.11.
[+] Made the inputs for Match Area and Match Room on the Report page
 into autocomplete fields.
[+] Added an option to make the default duration All Day.
[-] Changed the encoding of the text calendar in email notifications
 to base64 in order to CRLF sequences. Thanks to Thomas Bleher for
 the patch.
[*] Changed encoding of mail messages from 7bit to 8bit.
[*] Removed unnecessary <span> in the trailer. Thanks to patch from
 Thomas Bleher.
[*] Updated German translation, thanks to SF tracker #3293801.
[*] Clarified documention in auth_ext.php a little.
[*] Added some email debug information to help diagnose problems when
 sending emails.
[*] Extracted the per-area default settings from systemdefaults and
 put them into a new file, areadefaults.inc.php, to make it more
 obvious that these are the default settings for new areas and
 will have no effect on existing areas.
[*] Added lang.en as the fall-back language, in order that something
 is shown even when the $default_language_tokens file does not
 have a translated token. Based on a patch by Thomas Bleher.
[+] Added an option to report.php to summarize by type. Thamks to a
 patch submitted by Thomas Bleher.
[-] LDAP authentication change to fix (particular) configurations
 using $ldap_filter. Patch provided by rudd_j in SF tracker
 #3299258.
[-] Fixed bug preventing a room name being changed when only the case
 of letters in the name was being changed.
[-] Fixed bug which meant that a user logging in with an upper case
 version of his name. This only occurred in certain database
 configuratations.
[-] Fixed bug that caused durations to be formatted incorrectly in
 some languages (eg German). See SF tracker #3313655.
[+] On the Report page, converted input fields into auto-complete
 fields for custom fields that have select_options defined - For
 custom fields allowed $select_options to be an associative array,
 thus making it easy to change the displayed value without having
 to change the database. (See SF #3315966)
[+] Implemented an optional limit on the maximum length of a booking
 for non-admins. At the moment it is a global limit rather than
 per-area. It also does not yet prevent invalid booking lengths
 being shown in the edit_entry form.
[*] Tweaked iCalendar email data. (See also SF Tracker id 3297799)
[+] Added two new auth methods, 'crypt' and 'auth_basic'.
[-] A fix for use an uninitialised array in
 Themes/default/header.inc, as reported (and fix provided) by
 Henry Thompson on the mailing list.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.6 (Wed Feb 09 22:00:00 GMT 2011):

 and tidying the configuration variables defining the email configuration.
[-] Fixed bug causing approval of entries not to work when using
 PostgreSQL.

 buttons rather than checkboxes to make it slightly clearer what
 they do.

  the web interface.
[*] Added datepicker localisations for English (New Zealand) and English
 (Australia). Also corrected the localisation for Norwegian.
[-] Fixed a bug whereby book ahead policies would not be applied
 when using periods. [SF Support Request #3161926]
[*] Removed MRBS's non-Unicode mode. All installations will now run
 in Unicode, with all pages served as UTF-8 and all data in the database
 as UTF-8. If you upgrade an installation running in non-Unicode mode
 you must run the improved convert_db_to_utf8.php script, as detailed
 in UPGRADE.
[*] Updated/fixed Czech translation from Marek Grác.
[-] Fixed problem where start and end times do not appear correctly
 in the select boxes on the edit_entry form when using 12 hour
 format and running on a Windows server.

 submitted by rudd_j in SF #3166889.
[+] Implemented the ability to configure the default booking
 description with $default_description, as requested in SF
 #3001740.
[*] Now chooses a determined locale wven if MRBS doesn't have a
 translation for that locale. It's better than nothing to get
 dates/times right. Reported by 'corn_kid' as SF #2934313.
[*] Improved handling of SQL errors.
[*] Updated Spanish translation received from Jose Luis Martin
 Jimenez.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.5 (Mon Nov 22 22:00:00 GMT 2010):

 $default_type.
[*] Improved the translation helper script, checklang.php.
[-] Fixed a problem with the formatting of radio button labels on the
 edit area page in IE8.
[*] Improved selection of language to use in the Javascript date pickers.
[*] Made the day change automatically when the date picker in the
 page header is used.

 reported on the mailing list with confirming bookings.
[+] Added the ability to have "tentative" bookings, i.e. bookings which are
 not 100% certain to happen, but where the user wants to reserve the slot
 in the meantime.
[*] Expanded the documentation on timezones. See SF tracker ID: 3102895.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.4 (Wed Apr 21 17:00:00 BST 2010):

[*] Finnish translation update, provided by Tuomas.
[-] Fixed test for E_DEPRECATED, which was causing warnings on

 errors when $default_room was non-zero.
[+] Added the ability to have "provisional" bookings. i.e. bookings
 that need to be authorised before they enter the calendar.
[-] Fixed a problem with the display of the All Day checkbox in the
 edit_entry form in IE8.
[*] Set input focus on page entry for a few pages.
[-] Fixes for LDAP authentication scheme when $ldap_filter is set.
[+] Added the ability to limit how far in advance non-admin users
 can make bookings.
[*] Added  the name of the deleting user to email notifications of
  deleted entries.
[-] Fixed incorrect reporting of durations in email notifications.
[-] Fixed bug when using periods which meant that if you made a
 booking for N periods and there were fewer than N periods left in
 the day, the booking didn't flow on to the next day properly
 unless the start period was the first period of the day. 
[-] Fixed bug which caused the duration to be blank in email
 notifications for bookings when "All day" was checked.
[-]  Partially fixed a problem to do with the handling of All Day

[+] Added the ability to add custom fields for rooms, the custom
 fields must be added by the administrator in their favourite SQL
 admin tool.
[*] The "edit users" screen now handles textareas and checkboxes for
 custom fields, just like the room custom field handling does.
[+] Added a "custom_html" field for areas and rooms - this allows
 custom HTML to be attached to areas and rooms.
[*] Added check to see if the configuration variable $timezone is set -
 it's too important to count as a non-fatal configuration error.
[*] Improved the layout of email configuration settings in
 systemdefaults.inc.php to make them more clear.
[*] Added transaction support to MySQL DB abstractions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.3 (Tue Nov 24 22:00:00 GMT 2009):

[+] Moved default configuration values out of config.inc.php - this file
 should now only contain settings the administrator has changed (plus
 a few unfortunately necessary bits of internal code).
[-] Improved error reporting in the DB upgrade mechanism.
[*] Some code tidying to improve correctness and remove warnings.
[-] Added declaration of $PHP_SELF for PHP versions < 4.1.0.
[-] Fixed problem whereby empty cells in the month view weren't clickable.
[+] Added a configuration variable for showing week numbers in the mini
 calendars.
[-] Added SQL escaping for a variable not directly enterable by a user.
[-] Removed duplicate primary in PostgreSQL users table.
[-] Improved the PostgreSQL DB abstraction call for sql_table_exists().
[-] HTML entities in period names are now converted/stripped before
 being sent in emails.
[-] Fixed "You are <user>" display for users that include html special chars.
[*] Improved SQL to always use column names in ORDER BY clauses.
[-] Fixed JS click handling in edit area/room page.
[*] Added Bulgarian localisation (no translation yet).

[+] Added a configuration variable to allow forcing of booking resolution
 to the configuration variable $resolution rather than the DB settings.
[+] Added a configuration variable for setting a login link for the
 'remote_user' authentication scheme.
[*] Fix for setting UTF-8 locale on BSD, as provided in SF tracker #2859067.
[*] Removed use of ereg_replace(), it has been deprecated in PHP 5.3.
[-] A few fixes to honour privacy settings correctly.
[*] Improved error checking in search page.
[+] Added a sort key for rooms.
[*] Improved error handing for adding a user, so that user does not have
 to retype the form after an error.
[-] Fixed weekly and n-weekly bookings for the condition the user clicks
 a day that the repeat is not scheduled for.
[*] Changed behaviour of monthly and yearly repeats so that if a day does
 not exist in the month MRBS will use the last day of the month.
[+] Added code to disable E_DEPRECATED error class for PHP >= 5.3.
[-]  Fixed LDAP auth method so that $ldap_filter will work if you use
 $ldap_dn_search_attrib.
[*] Updated 'mysql' and 'mysqli' DB abstractions to request a UTF-8
 client charset if $unicode_encoding is true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.2 (Thu July 15 00:00 BST 2009): 

[+] Added checking of lengths of values for user-typeable fields, so that
 overly long field values aren't passed to the MRBS database, - something
 which causes errors with PostgreSQL. Adds new array variable $maxlength
 to config.inc.php that _must_ be populated if you are upgrading and keeping
 your old config.inc.php.
[+] Added automatic upgrade system for upgrading MRBS installations
 as the database schema changes. When an upgrade is needed MRBS will
 prompt for database admin user authentication details.
[+] Sites can also define their own local DB schema changes, using the
 sane upgrade system.
[*] Made access levels more flexible, by adding definitions for
 "maximum level" and "minimum editing level" into config.inc.php.
[*] Moved database table creation/alteration code out of edit_users.php,
 it is now done with the upgrade system.
[+] Added ability to make bookings private, with details only available
 to the booker and administrators. Feature provided by Cory Jaeger and later
 enhanced to allow private booking functionality to be configurable
 per area.
[*] Added check for PHP LDAP support into auth_ldap.inc, based on a suggestion
 from Chris Cook.
[-] Fixed issue with booknig display if booking "clipping" is turned off.
[-] Added some missing SQL escaping in various places in response to

        * Fixed all occurences (hopefully) of $vocab[] indices
          written without surrounding quotes.
[*] Changed all uses of <? to <?php.
[+] Merged change from John Beranek for an Advanced search function,
        requires 3 more translation tokens, which have been added to
        each language file, "search_button" should be OK, as I took
        the text from each language's "search" token.
[-] Fixed 2 problems in edit_entry.php as submitted on the mailing list.
[*] Added small enchancement to smb_auth.c, if you pass a username
        as group/user, it will change the NT group that is used for
        authentication.
[*] Improved shell escaping in auth_ext.inc. It now uses
        escapeshellarg() instead of escapeshellcmd(). If your PHP
        version is less than 4.0.3, then it includes escapeshellarg.inc
        which is a local implementation of that function.
[*] Added updated French translation, as provided by Thierry Wehr.
[*] Tided all language files again, they all have the same format
        and number of lines now, and are all missing at least 2 translations
        because of the new advanced search functionality.
[-] Fixed a number of bugs to make the Taiwanese translation work.
        The code to include language files based on HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
        has been improved, which ensures lang.zh-tw is included.
        Additionally, mincals.inc not longer does a substr() on the
        abbreviated weekday names, as this breaks terribly for any
        multibyte encoding, as it was only taking the first byte
        of a multibyte encoding. This has the impact that you now
        get Mon,Tue,Wed etc instead of M,T,W (using glibc's en_GB
        locale).
[-] print_header() now outputs a DOCTYPE identifier as well as
        sending Pragma no-cache and an Expires header in the
        past. This should help ensure the web pages don't get cached.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1-pre1 (Thu May 30 12:41:02 BST 2002)

[*] add config option for drop-down boxes to select area and room

[-] Declare $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE global in config.inc

[+] add translation:     Czech, SmEjDiL

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 (Thu Aug 30 22:26:54 BST 2001)

[+] Added two upgrade.xx.sql files which should have been in -pre2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0-pre2 (Sun Jul  8 13:43:53 BST 2001)

[*] Incorporated diff from Scott Leonard that allows you to configure a refresh
        time for roombooker web pages.  Set config variable $refresh_rate to the
        number of seconds to refresh after, or set to 0 to disable.
[+] Implemented "n-weekly" repeat type. Not sure I like the way it's phrased in
        the lang files, but the code works fine.  You can now have a meeting 
        that is repeated every 'n' weeks. e.g. every 5th Monday.  This required 
        a database change, which I've made available in upgrade2.my.sql and 
        upgrade2.pg.sql
[*] Tidied lang files, and ensured every file has all the required tokens.
        'wc -l lang.*' now shows all the files as having the same line count.
        Quite a few languages now have English bits in them though.
[*] Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that allow you to configure a filter
        for LDAP authentication.
[-] Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that solve problems with bookings made
        for times that have smaller granularity that the configured booking
        resolution.
[-] Fixed config.inc so that the correct lang.xx is included if
        HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is a comma-seperated list like "sv, en".
[*] Copied "rep_type_5" language token into Swedish and Spanish language
        files from English file.  Swedish and Spanish users were not able
        to use "monthly, corresponding day" repeats without the token being
        present.
[*] Checked in updates to lang.es (received from Pablo Gomez) and lang.de
        (received by Bernd Oeggl).
[*] Update lang.nl file (marc ter horst)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0-pre1 (Sun Mar  4 23:26:43 GMT 2001)

[*] Internationalised functions.inc. "Help", "Admin" and "Search:" are now lang
        strings. Also, fixed an error in lang.fr, $vocab["mrbs"] was defined 
        twice. (jberanek)
[*] Added double quotes around all uses of color and class attributes, as HTML
        dictates. (jberanek)
[*] On conflict, show start time and link to day/week/month views (redinger)
[+] Link each search result start time to entry's day view (bernd, beranak)

    Branch Merge (2001-02-24 ljb):
[*] Incorporated all changes from branch mrbs-0-9-1xp into CVS trunk.
[*] Undoes post-branch change (0.9.2) to remove "weekstarts" function.
[-] Fix undefined variable warning $edit_type in edit_entry.php

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.2 (Fri Feb  9 20:09:42 GMT 2001)

[*] Remove "weekstarts" functionality

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branch mrbs-0-9-1xp (2001-02-13 daniel):

[*] Added $I d$ tags to all files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branch mrbs-0-9-1xp (2001-02-10 ljb):

[*] For PHP4, rename *.php3 to *.php and changed all links.
[+] Major changes for database support for PostgreSQL:
        Original tables.sql renamed tables.my.sql for MySQL.
        Move sample data from tables.sql to sample-data.sql.
        New tables.pg.sql to build tables for PostgreSQL.
        New destroy.pg.sql to delete PostgreSQL tables and sequences.
        New grant.pg.sql - edit this and run to grant PostgreSQL rights.
        Replaced connect.inc with mysql.inc and pgsql.inc.
        New variable in config.inc "$dbsys" selects "mysql" or "pgsql".
        Renamed variables in config.inc to replace "mysql_" prefix with "db_".
        New wrapper funtions (see README.sqlapi) to encapsulate database calls.
        New pgsql.inc provides PostgreSQL implementation, and connects.
        New mysql.inc provides MySQL implementation, and connects.
        Rewrote all database calls to use wrapper functions.
        Rewrote all SQL statements to be standards-compliant, where possible.
            Used new wrapper routines where non-standard SQL is needed.
            Replace LEFT JOIN sequence with predicate-based joins.
        Changes to all error handling to ensure errors are properly reported.
[+] New week.php for Week View. (Experimental)
[+] New month.php for Month View. (Experimental)
[*] Added rows of links in trailer.inc to new month and week views.
[*] Changed Entry Type from 2 values (I=Internal, E=External) to 10 values.
        By default only the same 2 are defined in config.inc.
        Style sheet contains colors for 10 types.
        Selection box for type in edit/add entry form is dynamically built.
        Color key in day view dynamically built from defined types.
        Color key in day view moved to bottom of page.
[+] New Report function, linked from new button in the header. This makes
        a report on entries selected by date range and match strings.
[*] Add config.inc option db_nopersist to not use persistent DB connections.
[-] Add missing args to print_header call in del.php.
[+] Add config option eveningends_minutes to allow full 24 hour display with
        more resolution than 1 hour; also allows better control over the
        displayed hours, for example the last slot can now be 16:30-17:00.
[*] Removed unused functions from functions.inc: get_sunday_before()
        print_date_entries() display_unapproved_events() display_time()
        mysql_date_to_str() get_webrowser() hextoint() decode_str() encode_str()
        Also removed load_user_preferences code and calls to it.
[*] Remove redundant includes: functions.inc now assumes config.inc was
        included and does not include it again; search.php and view_entry.php do
        not need authentication so they don't need to include mrbs_auth.inc.
        Removed redundant connect to datbase in search.php.
[*] New error function fatal_error() to ensure errors are in a proper HTML page.
[+] Added new repeat type 5: Montly repeat, corresponding weekday and week.
[+] New authentication for Netware: auth_nw.inc (see README.nwauth). This is
        needed because nwauth takes the password on stdin, not cmdline.
[*] Used weblint to validate output pages and corrected HTML where needed.
        Quote all attribute values, fix bad attributes, balance tags.
[*] Moved HTML end tags into trailer.inc.
[*] Changed trailer to put " | " between dates, instead of ", " after each.
[-] In print_header, fix bad position of style.inc; must be in <HEAD> block.
[-] Fix syntax error when adding room if no capacity given (use 0).
[*] Change day.php to output equal-width room columns with centered headers.
[*] search.php: Use COUNT(*) and no ORDER BY when just getting match count.
[*] Fixed typo in view_entry.php on building up per-day repeat option string.
[-] Redesign loop for adding repeat dates to prevent it from scheduling 1 past
        the end date if the end date wasn't a date to schedule.
[*] Add "about" section to help.php to display viersion, system, database.
[-] Patch from BoK: fix "2 Decembers displayed if you pick "31 Nov" and Go.
        This makes sure the selected date is a valid date.
[-] Patch from robc: Fix to prevent edit entry to make it overlap another.
[+] New feature from Bo: Edit area and room names (new edit_area_room.php).
[*] Sort (order) the room names alphabetically in the main display (day.php).
    Changes found in CVS source:
[*] Changed "Booker's Name" to "Brief Description" (was in post-0.9pre1 CVS)
[*] View_entry uses multi-table query to show room description too (was in CVS)
[*] If no area is supplied, don't use 1 (or 0) since there might not be such
        an area (if it was deleted). Instead, use new get_default_area() which
        gets the lowest-numbered area.  In print_header(), don't pass along
        area as a hidden parameter if it wasn't supplied in the first place.
[*] Patch from BoK: Booking repeat Sat/Sun, only entered first Sun.
[*] Fixes to PHP magic quoting. We now turn of magic_quotes_runtime always,
        and use new slashes() and unslashes() to conditionaly deal with
        backslack-quotes depending on value of PHP's magic_quotes_gpc setting.
        NOTE: Possibly slightly incompatible change. Prior versions may have
        put pre-quoted values (area name, room name, booking name, booking
        description) into the database tables. This was wrong. If so, you
        will see funny \'s in the value displays.
        MRBS now should properly quote and unquote all values behind the scenes.
[*] Admin.php gets the area name from the database if it only has the ID.
[-] Patch from BoK: fix duplicate bookings from failure to delete caused by
        bad entry_type change to 2.
[*] Updates to site_faq.html - describe repeats, generalize Authentication info.
[*] Use a mutual exclusion lock (mutex) when adding an entry to prevent races.
[+] New maintenance SQL scripts: purge.my.sql and purge.pg.sql to delete old
        entries from your database (default 30 days old).
[*] Fixed field alignment in Add/Edit Entry form to right-justify labels.
[*] Security: Use EscapeShellCmd() on username and password in auth_ext.inc
[-] Fixed function toTimeString() to use lang[] for time units (I18N).
[*] Streamlined main query in day.php: omit unused columns, improve predicate
        to select by times from 6 compares to 2.
[*] In day.php, only fill in map entries during the day hours of interest.
[*] In lang.* language files, fixed quoting (found in CVS), comments, strip
        CRs and fixed some typos.
[-] Use double quotes around all string array indexes except inside strings.
        This avoids a PHP notice-level warning on each array reference.
[-] Fix undefined variable references to avoid notice-level PHP warnings.
[-] Bug fix: round meeting times up to $resolution units, not 30 minutes, and
        don't allow 0 minute meetings - make them 1 resolution unit instead.
[*] When using the footer to change dates, remember the current area.
[-] Changed view_entry to always show both time and date for start and end time;
        the CVS version was buggy and quirky in suppressing the date or time if
        it thought they were not important. Better to show too much info.
[+] New weekstarts and dateformat (Jan 01 vs 01 Jan) config (from BoK),
        generalized to show the week starting on any day.
[*] Add inline colors for non-CSS browsers (based on patch from John Beranek).
[*] Added current date header above day display (from John Beranek).
