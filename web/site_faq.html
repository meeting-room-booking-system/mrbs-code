  <div id="authenticate">
    <h4>How do I login?</h4>
    <p>
      The system can be configured to use one of several methods of authentication,
      including LDAP, Netware, and SMB. See your system administrator if you
      are having trouble logging in. Some functions are restricted to certain
      users, and other users will get the message <q>You do not have access rights to
      modify this item</q>. See your system administrator if this is not working
      correctly for you.
      If the system is configured to use LDAP authentication, this means that you
      login with the same username and password as you use for getting email
      e.g. <q>Mark Belanger</q> and <q>MyPassword</q>.

  <div id="meeting_delete">
    <h4>Why can't I delete/alter a meeting?</h4>
    <p>
      In order to delete or alter a meeting, you must be logged in as the
      same person that made the meeting.  Contact one of the meeting room
      administrators or the person who initially made the meeting to
      have it deleted or changed.

      Clicking on the desired time brings you into the booking screen.  Fill in
      the details and click "Save".
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of clicking on the desired time you can select a time range and
      also a room or day range by dragging the cursor over a group of cells in the
      day or week views.   When the mouse is released you will be taken to the
      booking screen and the time slots and the room or day range will have been
      filled in for you.

  <div id="fifth">
    <h4>What is the difference between <q>fifth</q> and <q>last</q>?</h4>
    <p>
      When making a monthly recurring booking, the <q>fifth</q> weekday of every month
      is just that.  If a month does not have a fifth weekday then no booking will be
      made for that month.   If you choose the <q>last</q> weekday of the month then a
      booking will be made on the fourth weekday if there is no fifth weekday.
    </p>
    <p>
      <q>Fifth last</q> works in a similar way, but counting backwards from the end of
      the month.  Using <q>first</q> will give you the fourth last weekday of the month
      if there is no fifth last weekday.

  <div id="repeating_delete">
    <h4>How do I delete one instance of a recurring meeting?</h4>
    <p>
      Select the day/room/time that you want to delete and select <dfn>Delete Entry</dfn>.

  <div id="multiple_sites">
    <h4>How do I schedule rooms at different sites?</h4>
    <p>
      You don't.  Presently the system cannot book two different rooms simultaneously.
      You must schedule each one separately.  Make sure that the time you want
      is available at both sites before making a booking.

  <div id="too_many">
    <h4>My meeting failed to be created because of <q>too many entries</q>!</h4>
    <p>
      No meeting can create more than 365 entries.  There needs to be some limit on the number of meetings created.  
      This number can be increased if necessary.

    <a href="#top">Top</a>
  </div>
  
  <div id="multiple_users">
    <h4>What happens if multiple people schedule the same meeting?</h4>
    <p>
      The short answer is: The first person to click on
      the <dfn>Submit</dfn> button wins.
      Behind the scenes, the system is using a proper multi-user, multi-threaded
      relational database than can handle many thousands of simultaneous users.

  <div id="internal_external">
    <h4>What is the difference between <q>Internal</q> and <q>External</q>?</h4>
    <p>
      By default, MRBS defines two meeting types. <dfn>Internal</dfn> means that the
      meeting will only be attended by employees.  An <dfn>External</dfn> meeting
      might also be attended by customers, vendors, investors, etc. Your site
      can define up to a total of 10 meeting types, according to your needs.
      Meetings are highlighted in the main calendar view with a color corresponding
      to their type, and a color key of all defined types is shown at the bottom
      of the main calendar view.

  <div id="about">
    <h4>How does the system work and who wrote it?</h4>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=5113">Meeting Room Booking System</a>
      is open source software that is distributed under the Gnu Public License(GPL).
      This means that software is free to use, distribute, and modify. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      The system is written mostly in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, 
      which is an open source programming language that can be embedded in web 
      pages similar in concept to Microsoft active server pages.  PHP is especially 
      good at accessing databases.
    </p>
    <p>  
      The database used for the system is either
      <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>
      or <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>.
      MySQL is a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust 
      SQL (Structured Query Language) database server that is also GPL.
      PostgreSQL is a full-featured multi-user open source Object Relational SQL
      database server.
    </p>
    <p> 
      The system will run on multiple platforms, including the PC architecture
      using the <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux</a> operating system.
      Linux, is a free, open source, unix-like operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web server being used is yet another piece of free, open source
      software.  The <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> web server is
      the world's most popular web server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom line is: <strong>every piece of this system, from the operating system to the application,
      is completely free - source code and all</strong>.
