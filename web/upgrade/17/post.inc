// We are about to introduce a new status, the confirmation status, for bookings
// that are not 100% certain to happen.   Instead of introducing yet another column
// in the database, we will use the existing status column to record any status information
// as follows:
//
// Bit 0:  Privacy status (set = private)
// Bit 1:  Approval status (set = not yet approved)
// Bit 2:  Confirmation status (set = not yet confirmed)
//
// Thus a booking with status 0x00 is a "standard" booking, ie confirmed, approved
// and open for all to see.
//
// This means that the existing status field has to be inverted (previously 1 or TRUE
// meant confirmed) and shifted one place to the left.

// In these queries we set timestamp=timestamp to prevent it being automatically set
// to the current time (only applies to MySQL - PostgreSQL timestamps don't update,
// but we'll do it anyway)

// Acquire mutex to lock out others trying to update the entry table (unlikely because
// the only other people able to update the database at this stage will be site admins
// who know the database username and password, but just in case ...)
