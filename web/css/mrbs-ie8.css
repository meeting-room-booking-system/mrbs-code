/* Fixes for Internet Explorer 8 */


/* ------------ FORM_GENERAL ------------------------*/
/* Even though no max-height is set, IE8 will clip content */
/* when overflow is set to hidden.    Therefore we need to */
/* set it to visible explicitly for the y direction        */
.form_general label {overflow-y: visible}
.form_general #ad label {overflow-y: auto} /* undo for all-day checkbox */


/* ------------ TRAILER.INC ---------------------*/

/* opacity for IE8 is implemented with filter, but only works if the element */
/* is positioned;  you can also get filter to work by using zoom.   However  */
/* the zoom only works if the element is a block or inline-block; we need it */
/* to be inline, hence the inline-block.    Note also that in IE8 you have   */
/* to use -ms-zoom and -ms-filter instead of zoom and filter                 */
#trailer span.hidden {
    display: inline-block;            /* to force the zoom to work */
    -ms-zoom: 1;                      /* to force the filter to work */
    -ms-filter: "alpha(opacity=50)";  /* keep the value in step with the main stylesheet */
}
