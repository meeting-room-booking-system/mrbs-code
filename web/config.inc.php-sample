 *   If you want to change any of the other settings in systemdefaults.inc.php

 *   when you upgrade to a new version of MRBS the config file is preserved.

 *   NOTE: if you include or require other files from this file, for example

/**********
 * Timezone
 **********/

// The timezone your meeting rooms run in. It is especially important
// to set this if you're using PHP 5 on Linux. In this configuration
// if you don't, meetings in a different DST than you are currently
// in are offset by the DST offset incorrectly.
//
// Note that timezones can be set on a per-area basis, so strictly speaking this
// setting should be in areadefaults.inc.php, but as it is so important to set
// the right timezone it is included here.
//
// When upgrading an existing installation, this should be set to the
// timezone the web server runs in.  See the INSTALL document for more information.
//
// A list of valid timezones can be found at http://php.net/manual/timezones.php
// The following line must be uncommented by removing the '//' at the beginning
//$timezone = "Europe/London";


/*******************
 * Database settings
 ******************/

// If you are using cPanel on your web server, make sure you include the prefix,
// typically 8 characters followed by an underscore, in your database name and
// database username.  For example $db_database = "abcdefgh_mrbs". (Note: this
// prefix is not the same as the table prefix below.)

// Which database system: "pgsql"=PostgreSQL, "mysql"=MySQL
$dbsys = "mysql";
// Hostname of database server. For pgsql, can use "" instead of localhost
// to use Unix Domain Sockets instead of TCP/IP. For mysql "localhost"
// tells the system to use Unix Domain Sockets, and $db_port will be ignored;
// if you want to force TCP connection you can use "127.0.0.1".
$db_host = "localhost";
// If you need to use a non standard port for the database connection you
// can uncomment the following line and specify the port number
// $db_port = 1234;
// Database name:
$db_database = "mrbs";
// Schema name.  This only applies to PostgreSQL and is only necessary if you have more
// than one schema in your database and also you are using the same MRBS table names in
// multiple schemas.
//$db_schema = "public";
// Database login user name:
$db_login = "mrbs";
// Database login password:
$db_password = 'mrbs-password';
// Prefix for table names.  This will allow multiple installations where only
// one database is available
$db_tbl_prefix = "mrbs_";
// Set $db_persist to TRUE to use PHP persistent (pooled) database connections.  Note
// that persistent connections are not recommended unless your system suffers significant
// performance problems without them.   They can cause problems with transactions and
// locks (see http://php.net/manual/en/features.persistent-connections.php) and although
// MRBS tries to avoid those problems, it is generally better not to use persistent
// connections if you can.
$db_persist = false;
