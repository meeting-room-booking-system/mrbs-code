/*******************
 * Themes
 *******************/

// Choose a theme for the MRBS.   The theme controls two aspects of the look and feel:
//   (a) the styling:  the most commonly changed colours, dimensions and fonts have been 
//       extracted from the main CSS file and put into the styling.inc file in the appropriate
//       directory in the Themes directory.   If you want to change the colour scheme, you should
//       be able to do it by changing the values in the theme file.    More advanced styling changes
//       can be made by changing the rules in the CSS file.
//   (b) the header:  the header.inc file which contains the function used for producing the header.
//       This enables organisations to plug in their own header functions quite easily, in cases where
//       the desired corporate look and feel cannot be changed using the CSS alone and the mark-up
//       itself needs to be changed.
//
//  MRBS will look for the files "styling.inc" and "header.inc" in the directory Themes/$theme and
//  if it can't find them will use the files in Themes/default.    A theme directory can contain
//  a replacement styling.inc file or a replacement header.inc file or both.

// Available options are:

// "default"        Default MRBS theme
// "classic126"     Same colour scheme as MRBS 1.2.6

$theme = "default";


/*******************
 * Calendar settings
 *******************/
 
// MRBS has two different modes of operation: "times" and "periods".   "Times"
// based bookings allow you to define regular consecutive booking slots, eg every
// half an hour from 7.00 am to 7.00 pm.   "Periods" based bookings are useful
// in, for example, schools where the booking slots are of different lengths
// and are not consecutive because of change-over time or breaks.

// It is not possible to swap between these two options once bookings have
// been created and to have meaningful entries.  This is due to differences
// in the way that the data is stored.

// It is however possible to configure the system so that some areas operate in
// "periods" mode and others in "times" mode.    Therefore the configuration variable
// that determines the default setting for new areas appears together with other
// variables that can be set on a per-area basis in the file areadefaults.inc.php.
// This is done to draw attention to the fact that they are default settings for new
// areas only and to avoid frustration when trying to change settings for existing
// areas: this is done by editing the settings for an area using a web browser by
// following the "Rooms" link in MRBS.


// GENERAL SETTINGS
// ----------------

// This is the maximum number of rows (timeslots or periods) that one can
// expect to see in the day and week views.    It is used by mrbs.css.php for
// creating classes.    It does not matter if it is too large, except for the
// fact that more CSS than necessary will be generated.  (The variable is ignored
// if $times_along_top is set to TRUE).

$max_slots = 60;


// TIMES SETTINGS
// --------------

// The times settings can all be configured on a per-area basis, so these variables
// appear in the areadefaults.inc.php file.



// PERIODS SETTINGS
// ----------------

// The "Periods" settings are ignored if $enable_periods is FALSE.

// Define the name or description for your periods in chronological order
// For example:
// $periods[] = "Period&nbsp;1"
// $periods[] = "Period&nbsp;2"
// ...
// or
// $periods[] = "09:15&nbsp;-&nbsp;09:50"
// $periods[] = "09:55&nbsp;-&nbsp;10:35"
// ...
// &nbsp; is used to ensure that the name or description is not wrapped
// when the browser determines the column widths to use in day and week
// views
//
// NOTE:  MRBS assumes that the descriptions are valid HTML and can be output
// directly without any encoding.    Please ensure that any special characters
// are encoded, eg '&' to '&amp;', '>' to '&gt;', lower case e acute to 
// '&eacute;' or '&#233;', etc.

// NOTE:  The maximum number of periods is 60.   Do not define more than this.
unset($periods);    // Include this line when copying to config.inc.php
$periods[] = "Period&nbsp;1";
$periods[] = "Period&nbsp;2";
// NOTE:  The maximum number of periods is 60.   Do not define more than this.

// NOTE:  See INSTALL for information on how to add or remove periods in an
// existing database.


/******************

// appear in the areadefaults.inc.php file.
